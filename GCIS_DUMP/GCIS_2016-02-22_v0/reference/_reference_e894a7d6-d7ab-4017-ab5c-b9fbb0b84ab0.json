        "Abstract": "In this article, we provide an overview of the demographic trends that have impacted and will continue to impact the \u201cwicked\u201d wildfire management problem in the United States, with particular attention to the emergence of the wildland\u2013urban interface (WUI). Although population growth has had an impact on the emergence of the WUI, the deconcentration of population and housing, amenity-driven population growth in select nonmetropolitan counties, and interregional population shifts to the West and Southeast have had and will continue to have much greater impacts. In the coming decades, we can expect the retirement of the baby boom generation to exacerbate these trends.",
