    "description": "ABSTRACT: The BOREAS RSS-10 team investigated the magnitude of daily, seasonal, and yearly variations of PAR from ground and satellite observations. This data set contains satellite estimates of surface-incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400-700 nm, MJ m-2) at 1 degree spatial resolution. The spatial coverage is circumpolar from latitudes of 41 to 66 degrees N latitude. The temporal coverage is from May through September for years 1979 through 1989. Eleven-year statistics are also provided: mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation for 1979-1989. The PAR estimates were derived from the global gridded ultraviolet reflectivity data product (average of 360, 380 nm) from the Nimbus-7 Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS). Image mask data are provided for identifying the boreal forest zone, and ocean/land and snow/ice covered areas. The data are available as binary image format data files. Companion files include example thumbnail images that may be viewed and the image data files downloaded using a convenient viewer utility.",
