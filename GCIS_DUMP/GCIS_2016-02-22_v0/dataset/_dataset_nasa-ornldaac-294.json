    "description": "ABSTRACT: The BOREAS RSS-07 team collected various data sets to develop and validate an algorithm to allow the retrieval of the spatial distribution of LAI from remotely sensed images. Ground measurements of LAI and FPAR absorbed by the plant canopy were made using the LAI-2000 and TRAC optical instruments during focused periods from 09-AUG-1993 to 19-SEP-1994. The measurements were intensive at the NSA and SSA tower sites, but were made just once or twice at auxiliary sites.",
