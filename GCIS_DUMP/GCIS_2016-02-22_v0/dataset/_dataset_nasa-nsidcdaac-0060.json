    "description": "This archive of daily rawinsonde measurements of wind direction and speed, atmospheric pressure, humidity, air temperature, and geopotential height as well as surface-based observation of cloud cover (amount, type and height) from Soviet North Pole drifting stations was assembled under the direction of Dr. J. Kahl, with funding from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Science Foundation, and the Electric Power Research Institute. Soundings were recorded from April 19, 1954 to July 31, 1990 at drifting stations located in the Arctic Ocean, north of approximately 70 degrees North. Data were obtained from several different sources. All of these data are ultimately derived from the set of bound volumes of handwritten tables kept at the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI) in St. Petersburg, Russia. Data are in 21 ASCII text format files with an average size of under 10 MB. The data are available via ftp.",
