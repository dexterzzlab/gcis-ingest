    "description": "ABSTRACT: The Thematic Mapper sensor system was used to collect the original data between February 1987 and October 1989 from which this data set was produced. Landsat TM extract data contains the average instrument corrected spectral radiances for each of the seven spectral bands. In addition, the associated view and solar angles are available for each of 39 FIFE ground measurement sites. The Site Reflectances Extracted from Landsat TM Imagery Data Set also contains reflectance values and exoatmospheric reflectance values for these seven spectral bands. These reflectances were derived using the sensor calibrated radiances which were corrected for exoatmospheric effects using atmospheric aerosol optical thickness and gaseous absorption profile measurements, when available. The atmospheric correction algorithm of Fraser et al. (1989) was used to calculate reflectance in the visible and infrared channels. The thermal data were corrected using parameters derived from the Lowtran-7 atmospheric path radiance model (Kneizys et al. 1988).",
