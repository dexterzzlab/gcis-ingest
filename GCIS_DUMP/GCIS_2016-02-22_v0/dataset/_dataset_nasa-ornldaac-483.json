    "description": "ABSTRACT: As part of BOREAS, the RSS-15 team conducted an investigation using SIR-C , X-SAR and Landsat TM data for estimating total above-ground dry biomass for the SSA and NSA modeling grids and component biomass for the SSA. Relationships of backscatter to total biomass and total biomass to foliage, branch, and bole biomass were used to estimate biomass density across the landscape. The procedure involved image classification with SAR and Landsat TM data and development of simple mapping techniques using combinations of SAR channels. For the SSA, the SIR-C data used were acquired on 06-Oct-1994, and the Landsat TM data used were acquired on September 2, 1995. The maps of the NSA were developed from SIR-C data acquired on 13-Apr-1994.",
