    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set provides average hourly measured, modeled enhancements, and background methane (CH4) concentrations, atmospheric ethane (C2H6) measurements, prior CH4 flux fields by sector, and a spatial reconstruction of natural gas (NG) consumption in Boston, Massachusetts and the surrounding region. Atmospheric CH4 concentrations were measured continuously from September 2012 through August 2013 at four locations and atmospheric ethane was measured continuously for several months during 2012-2014 at one location. Spatial models of prior CH4 emissions and natural gas consumption are given for an ~18,000 km^2 area centered on Boston, MA.",
