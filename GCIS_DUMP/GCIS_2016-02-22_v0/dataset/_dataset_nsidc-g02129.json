    "description": "Weekly Southern Ocean ice limits, have been digitized from U.S. Navy Fleet Weather Facility ice charts, at the Max-Planck Institut fur Meteorologie, Hamburg. Coverage is from 1 January 1973 to 31 June 1978. Data are gridded at 5 degree longitude intervals and are available via ftp. <strong>Note:</strong> NOAA@NSIDC believes these data to be of value, however, they should be used with caution because we are unable to quality check the data or provide documentation due to lack of funding.
