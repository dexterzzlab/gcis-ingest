    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set provides simulated minimum, average, and maximum monthly rainfall, potential evapotranspiration, water deficit, and water surplus values for the Ji-Parana River basin, Rondonia, Brazil. The Thornthwaite-&#194;&#128;&#194;&#147;Mather climatological model integrated into a Geographic Information System (GIS) was used to derive the data by utilizing Advanced Very High Resolution Radar (AVHRR) images for temperatures, rainfall amounts from gauges within and around the basin, soil profiles, and land cover maps as model inputs. The monthly water balance for the Ji-Parana river basin is simulated from February 1995 through December 1996 (Victoria et al., 2007). Data are also provided from the Ji-Parana subbasin stations for total basin rainfall, basin discharge and basin evapotranspiration. This data was used to check the results of the water balance model. There are 2 comma-delimited data files with this data set.",
