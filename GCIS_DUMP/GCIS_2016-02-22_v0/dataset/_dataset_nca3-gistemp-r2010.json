    "description": "The NASA GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP) provides a measure of the changing global surface temperature with monthly resolution for the period since 1880, when a reasonably global distribution of meteorological stations was established. Input data for the analysis, collected by many national meteorological services around the world, is the unadjusted data of the Global Historical Climatology Network (Peterson and Vose, 1997) except that the USHCN station records included were replaced by a later corrected version. These data were augmented by SCAR data from Antarctic stations. Documentation of our analysis is provided by Hansen et al. (1999), with several modifications described by Hansen et al. (2001). The GISS analysis is updated monthly.\r\n \r\nThe data is available on an equal area grid. NASA provides code to read it onto a 2x2 grid. They have two smoothing levels available for their updated data: 250km and 1200km smoothing. They make available a land only version and a version which includes the hadISST (post Dec 1981) and NOAA OI V2 for data over the oceans. There ARE missing data values.",
