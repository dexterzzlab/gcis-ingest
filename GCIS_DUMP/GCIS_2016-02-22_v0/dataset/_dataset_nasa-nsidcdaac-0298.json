    "description": "This data set includes data collected over the Soil Moisture Experiment 2003 (SMEX03) area of Georgia, USA between 16 June and 21 July 2003. The parameters measured were Leaf Area Index (LAI), Multispectral Radiometer (MSR) reflectance, plant height, plant density, areal wet biomass, areal dry biomass, and areal water content. Sampling was performed on fields typical of the South-Georgia Agricultural area. Sampling was concentrated in the Upper Suwannee Watershed, with a greater concentration of sites within the Little River Experimental Watershed. Data are provided in ASCII text files, and are available via FTP. These data were collected as part of a validation study for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). AMSR-E is a mission instrument launched aboard NASA's Aqua Satellite on 04 May 2002. AMSR-E validation studies linked to SMEX are designed to evaluate the accuracy of AMSR-E soil moisture data. Specific validation objectives include assessing and refining soil moisture algorithm performance; verifying soil moisture estimation accuracy; investigating the effects of vegetation, surface temperature, topography, and soil texture on soil moisture accuracy; and determining the regions that are useful for AMSR-E soil moisture measurements.",
