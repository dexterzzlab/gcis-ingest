    "description": "ABSTRACT: The BOREAS HYD-03 team collected several data sets related to the hydrology of forested areas. This data set includes measurements of wind speed and direction; air temperature; relative humidity; and canopy, trunk, and snow surface temperatures within three forest types. The data were collected in the SSA-OJP (1994) and SSA-OBS and SSA-OA (1996). Measurements were taken for 3 days in 1994 and 4 days at each site in 1996. These measurements were intended to be short term to allow the relationship between subcanopy measurements and those collected above the forest canopy to be determined. The subcanopy estimates of wind speed were used in a snow melt model to help predict the timing of snow ablation.",
