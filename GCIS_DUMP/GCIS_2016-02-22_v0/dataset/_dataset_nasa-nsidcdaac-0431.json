    "description": "Notice to Data Users: The documentation for this data set was provided solely by the Principal Investigator(s) and was not further developed, thoroughly reviewed, or edited by NSIDC. Thus, support for this data set may be limited. This data set contains Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) satellite imagery of the Bering Sea and Chukchi Sea areas to complement the joint in situ and aircraft Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer Sea Ice Product Validation (AMSRIce03) campaign conducted in March 2003. The 150 m resolution images correspond to the panchromatic band (band 8), and were collected on 13, 15, 20, and 22 March 2003. The total volume of this data set is approximately 161 megabytes. Data are provided in binary image files with corresponding ENVI header files, and are available via FTP. These data were collected as part of a validation study for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). AMSR-E is a mission instrument launched aboard NASA's Aqua Satellite on 04 May 2002.",
