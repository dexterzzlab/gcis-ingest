    "description": "This data set is part of the NASA Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) program. This data set provides maps of glacier outlet areas, some of which have shown profound velocity changes over the MEaSUREs observation period from 2000 to 2012. The data are provided in addition to the ice-sheet-wide data from the related data set, MEaSUREs Greenland Ice Sheet Velocity Map from InSAR Data (NSIDC-0478: http://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0478.html). The InSAR Selected Glacier Site Velocity Maps are produced from TerraSAR-X (TSX) image pairs collected between January 2009 and December 2012. Data are available via FTP, in 4-byte Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) floating point format. Note: These data are considered provisional pending a review by the MEaSUREs program. Once the data have been reviewed, this statement will be removed from this documentation.",
