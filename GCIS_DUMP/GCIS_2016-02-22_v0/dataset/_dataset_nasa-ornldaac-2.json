    "description": "ABSTRACT: The FIFE Thirty Minute Rainfall Data Data Set contains data from thirty rain gauges located in the Kings Creek basin in the northwest corner of the FIFE study area during 1987. Reliability of the gauges were such that at any particular time, data from approximately 20 were recovered. The high temperatures and humidity, plus software problems in the loggers, resulted in data losses. The collected data were of high quality and sufficiently many gauges were working that the structure of the raincells can be observed from the gauge data.",
