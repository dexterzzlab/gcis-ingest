    "description": "ABSTRACT: The BOREAS HYD-08 team made measurements of surface hydrological processes at the SSA (1996) and NSA OBS (1994) Tower Flux sites, supporting its research into point hydrological processes and the spatial variation of these processes. These data were collected during the 1994 and 1996 field campaigns. Data collected may be useful in characterizing canopy interception, drip, throughfall, moss interception, drainage, evaporation, and capacity during the growing season at daily temporal resolution. This particular data set contains the measurements of throughfall, which is the amount of precipitation that fell through the canopy. A nested spatial sampling plan was implemented to determine spatial variations of the measured hydrological processes and ultimately the impact of these variations on modeled carbon and water budgets.",
