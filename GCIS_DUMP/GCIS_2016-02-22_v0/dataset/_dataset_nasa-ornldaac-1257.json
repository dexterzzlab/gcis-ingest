    "description": "ABSTRACT: These data consist of high-resolution maps of aboveground biomass at four forested sites in the US: Garcia River Tract in California, Anne Arundel and Howard Counties in Maryland, Parker Tract in North Carolina, and Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire. Biomass maps were generated using a combination of field data (forest inventory and Lidar) and modeling approaches. Estimates of uncertainty are also provided for the Maryland site using two different modeling methodologies. These data provide estimates of aboveground biomass for the nominal year of 2011 at 20-50 meter resolution in units of megagrams of carbon per hectare (or acre for the Garcia Tract site). The data are presented as a series of 11 GeoTIFF (*.tif) files.",
