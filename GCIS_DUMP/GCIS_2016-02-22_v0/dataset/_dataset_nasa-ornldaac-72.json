    "description": "ABSTRACT: The Surface Temperatures from UNL Data Set contains surface temperatures collected between July 15 and August 11, 1989 at three FIFE area sites. These surface temperatures were measured with an Everest multiplexed infrared thermometer (IRT) Model 4000 predominantly in the solar principal plane, with nadir and off-nadir, view-zenith angles (mounted on the portable mast with the Barnes Model 12-1000 Modular Multiband Radiometer (MMR)). The purpose of this study was to determine the variability of emitted fluxes as a function of topography, vegetative community and management practice. Spatial and temporal sampling at sites 906 (2133-EVN), 916 (4439-EVN), and 966 (2437-EVN) was achieved. Measurements were typically coordinated with aircraft and/or satellite overpasses.",
