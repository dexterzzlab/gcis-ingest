    "description": "ABSTRACT: The BOREAS TF-11 team gathered a variety of data to complement their tower flux measurements collected at the SSA Fen site. The data described in this document were made by the TF-11 team at the SSA Fen site to quantify the effect that the films observed to form on open water surfaces had on the transfer of carbon dioxide and methane from the water to the air. Measurements of fluxes of carbon dioxide and methane were made in 1994 and in 1996 using the chamber flux method. A gas chromatograph and a LI-COR LI-6200 were used to measure concentrations and to calculate the fluxes.",
