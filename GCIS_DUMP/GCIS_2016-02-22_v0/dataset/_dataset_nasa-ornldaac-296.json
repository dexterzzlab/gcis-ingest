    "description": "ABSTRACT: The BOREAS RSS-08 team performed research to evaluate the effect of seasonal weather and landcover heterogeneity on boreal forest regional water and carbon fluxes using a process level ecosystem model, BIOME-BGC, coupled with remote sensing-derived parameter maps of key state variables. This data set contains derived maps of landcover type and crown and stem biomass as model inputs to determine annual evapotranspiration, gross primary production, autotrophic respiration and net primary productivity within the BOREAS SSA-MSA, at a 30 m spatial resolution. Model runs were conducted over a 3 year period from 1994-1996, images are provided for each of those years.",
