    "description": "The NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT) Level 2.5 high-resolution merged ocean wind vectors and sigma-0 in 25 km wind vector cell (WVC) swaths contain daily data from ascending and descending passes. Wind vectors are accurate to within 2 m/s (vector speed) and 20 degrees (vector direction). Wind vectors are not considered valid in rain contaminated regions; rain flags and precipitation information are not provided. Data is flagged where measurements are either missing or ambiguous. In the presence of land or sea ice winds values are set to 0, and sigma-0 values are preserved where measurements are available. This is the most up-to-date version, which designates the final phase of calibration, validation and science data processing, which was completed in November of 1998, on behalf of the JPL NSCAT Project; wind vectors are processed using the NSCAT-2 geophysical model function.",
