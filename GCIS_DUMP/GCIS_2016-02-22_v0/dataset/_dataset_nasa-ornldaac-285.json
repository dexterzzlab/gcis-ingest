    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set was gridded by BORIS staff from a vector data set received from Canadian Soil Information System (CanSIS). The original data came in two parts that covered Saskatchewan and Manitoba. The data were gridded and merged into one data set of 84 files covering the BOReal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) region. The data were gridded into the Albers Equal-Area Conic (AEAC) projection. Because the mapping of the two provinces was done separately in the original vector data, there may be discontinuities in some of the soil layers because of different interpretations of certain soil properties.",
