    "description": "ABSTRACT: This is a data set of spectral reflectance (400-2500 nm) of small, monospecific canopies formed from seedlings of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum). The trees were provided different levels of fertilization in order to produce canopies with varying nitrogen and chlorophyll concentration. For the Douglas-fir, fertilization was provided during the dormant season, so there were no differences in growth or leaf area among canopies, and canopies were at a constant density with varying foliar chemistry. For the maple, seedlings were aggregated at various densities, producing a matrix of leaf area as well as chemistry variations. Canopy reflectance was measured under natural sunlight, and canopies were then destructively analyzed for chemical content and leaf area (see ACCP Seedling Canopy Chemistry Data).",
