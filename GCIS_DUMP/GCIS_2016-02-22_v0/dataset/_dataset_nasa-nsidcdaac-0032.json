    "description": "This Level-3 Equal-Area Scalable Earth-Grid (EASE-Grid) Brightness Temperature data set, collected since 09 July 1987, is a part of the NOAA/NASA Pathfinder Program. The data set consists of gridded data from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) and the Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) in three equal-area projections: Northern Hemisphere, Southern Hemisphere, and full global. The data gridding technique maximizes the radiometric integrity of the original brightness temperature values, maintains high spatial and temporal precision, and involves no averaging of original swath data. Spatial coverage is global and a spatial resolution of 25 km is available for all channels. Channels at 85 and 91 GHz are also provided at 12.5 km. For a given projection, there are 18 brightness temperature files per day and two corresponding time files. Data are contained in flat binary files and are available via FTP as processing is completed.",
