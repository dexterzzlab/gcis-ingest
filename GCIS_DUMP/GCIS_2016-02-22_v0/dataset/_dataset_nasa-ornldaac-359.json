    "description": "ABSTRACT: The BOREAS TE-23 team collected map plot data in support of its efforts to characterize and interpret information on canopy architecture and understory cover at the BOREAS tower flux sites and selected auxiliary sites from May to August 1994. Mapped plots (typical dimensions 50 m x 60 m) were set up and characterized at all BOREAS forested tower flux and selected auxiliary sites. Detailed measurement of the mapped plots included 1) stand characteristics (location, density, basal area); 2) map locations DBH of all trees; 3) detailed geometric measures of a subset of trees (height, crown dimensions); and 4) understory cover maps. The data are stored in tabular ASCII files.",
