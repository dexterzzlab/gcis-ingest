    "description": "This dataset polar-stereographic-gridded, daily averaged Sigma-0 retrievals over the Antarctic Polar region from the SeaWinds L1B retrievals, which are generated using a Scatterometer Image Reconstruction (SIR) technique developed by Dr. David Long at Brigham Young University (BYU); the processed files are therefore known as SIR files. The SeaWinds scatterometer scans at two nominal incidence angles, 46 degrees and 54.1 degrees, corresponding to the inner and outer beams respectively. The inner beam is horizontally polarized while the outer beam is vertically polarized. The SIR files are separated according to polarization. For example, one SIR file for a particular day will contain the gridded average Sigma-0 values for the horizontally polarized L1B retrievals, while the other will contain those from the vertically polarized L1B retrievals. These SIR files were also used to generate a complimentary dataset of GIF images representing the daily averaged Sigma-0, which is meant for browse purposes only and available here: http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/SEAWINDS_BYU_L3_OW_SIGMA0_ANTARCTICA_POLAR-STEREOGRAPHIC_BROWSE_IMAGES. An expanded version of this dataset includes the full daily Sigma-0 statistcs: http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/SEAWINDS_BYU_L3_OW_SIGMA0_ANTARCTICA_POLAR-STEREOGRAPHIC_BROWSE_MAPS_FULL. This dataset is generated by the Scatterometer Climate Record Pathfinder (SCP) project at BYU.",
