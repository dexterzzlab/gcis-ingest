    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set contains soil water measurements to a depth of 3 meters for the years 1999, 2000, and 2001, and total monthly precipitation data for 1999-2000. The data were collected from a pasture site located at the Embrapa Pasture Research Site, a former cattle research station 54 km north of Manaus on the highway BR 174 Manaus-Boa Vista, Brazil. There are three comma-separated data files (.csv) with this data set. DATA QUALITY STATEMENT: The Data Center has determined that there are questions about the quality of the data reported in this data set. The data set has missing or incomplete data, metadata, or other documentation that diminishes the usability of the products. KNOWN PROBLEMS: There is no associated research documentation and the units were not provided with the data.",
