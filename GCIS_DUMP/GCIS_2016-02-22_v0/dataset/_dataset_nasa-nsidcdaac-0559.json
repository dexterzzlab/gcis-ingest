    "description": "Notice to Data Users: The documentation for this data set was provided solely by the Principal Investigator(s) and was not further developed, thoroughly reviewed, or edited by NSIDC. Thus, support for this data set may be limited. This data set contains in situ data collected using a multispectral radiometer and a plant-canopy analyzer over the Soil Moisture Experiment 2004 (SMEX04) areas of Arizona, USA and Sonora, Mexico. The experiment was conducted 20 July 2004 to 24 August 2004. Sampling was performed on sites approximately 800 meters by 800 meters in size. The parameters for this data set include Leaf Area Index (LAI), Multispectral Radiometer Reflectance, wet biomass, dry biomass, water content, and site vegetation cover. The total volume for this data set is approximately 1.5 megabytes. Data are provided in Microsoft Excel files, and are available via FTP. These data were collected as part of a validation study for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). AMSR-E is a mission instrument launched aboard NASA's Aqua Satellite on 04 May 2002. AMSR-E validation studies linked to SMEX are designed to evaluate the accuracy of AMSR-E soil moisture data. Specific validation objectives include assessing and refining soil moisture algorithm performance; verifying soil moisture estimation accuracy; investigating the effects of vegetation, surface temperature, topography, and soil texture on soil moisture accuracy; and determining the regions that are useful for AMSR-E soil moisture measurements.",
