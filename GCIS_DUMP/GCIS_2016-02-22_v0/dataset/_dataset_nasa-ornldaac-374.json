    "description": "ABSTRACT: Chamber flux measurements were taken at the Northern Study Area (NSA) Old Jack Pine (OJP), Young Jack Pine (YJP), Old Black Spruce (OBS), and Beaver Pond (BP) sites during the summer of 1994. The purpose of these measurements was to examine the trace gas exchange between the atmosphere and the boreal soils. The BOREAS TGB-01 team made methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) dark chamber flux measurements from 16- May-1994 through 13-Sep-1994. Gas samples were extracted approximately every 7 days from dark chambers and analyzed at the NSA lab facility.",
