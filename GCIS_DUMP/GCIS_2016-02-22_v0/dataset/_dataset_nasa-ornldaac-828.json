    "description": "ABSTRACT: The Southern African Regional Science Initiative (SAFARI 2000) was conducted in part to investigate the impacts of the large-scale transport and deposition of increasingly anthropogenic emissions on southern African biogeochemical cycling. Aerosol samples from the Mongu site in eastern Zambia were collected and analyzed to identify chemical biomarkers during the SAFARI 2000 dry season field campaign. Total suspended particulate aerosol samples were collected diurnally for a period of two weeks during August and September of 2000.These data include bulk organic carbon, nitrogen and sulfur stable isotopic measurements of total suspended particulate aerosols and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis of fatty acids extracted from collected aerosols. These data were used to chemically describe temporal variability in aerosol compositions.",
