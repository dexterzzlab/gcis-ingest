    "description": "ABSTRACT: Surface flux measurements were made at selected sites within the FIFE area. Each surface flux station was capable of measuring the fluxes of net radiation, sensible heat, and latent heat. The data contained in the Eddy Correlation Surface Flux Observations (USGS) Data Set were collected from two sites located in the northwest and southwest quadrants on slight inclines in the FIFE study area. These data are available only during the four Intensive Field Campaigns, held during the growing season of 1987, May 25 - October 17. During this period there are 66 days of data.",
