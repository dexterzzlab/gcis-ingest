    "description": "The NASA IceBridge HiCARS 1 Level-2 Geolocated Ice Thickness (IR1HI2) data set contains Ice Thickness, Surface Elevations, and Bed Elevation measurements taken over Antarctica using the Hi-Capability Radar Sounder (HiCARS) instrument. The data were collected by scientists working on the Investigating the Cryospheric Evolution of the Central Antarctic Plate (ICECAP) project, which is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) with additional support from NASA Operation IceBridge. The data are stored in ASCII text format and are available for periodic, ongoing campaigns from 16 November 2009 to the present via FTP.",
