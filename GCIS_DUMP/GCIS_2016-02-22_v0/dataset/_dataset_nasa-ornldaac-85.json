    "description": "ABSTRACT: The SE-590 Leaf Level Spectral Observations from GSFC Data Set were acquired in situ with a Spectron SE590 spectroradiometer fitted with the 1 degree IFOV lens, and coupled with a LI-COR integrating sphere. The purpose in collecting SE590 leaf reflectance and transmittance data was to characterize the optical properties of the canopy components to gain a better understanding of how these optical properties contribute to canopy reflection and absorption of radiation. To measure the reflectance and transmittance of leaf surfaces an integrating sphere was used. The integrating sphere collected all of the radiation reflected from or transmitted through a surface. These data are the average spectral optical properties (i.e., reflectance, transmittance) and the standard deviations for the three dominant species found on each of three sites: 916 (i.e., Big Bluestem, Indiangrass, and Switchgrass), 906 (i.e., Big Bluestem, Indiangrass, and Switchgrass), and 26 (i.e., Big Bluestem, Lovegrass and Dropseed) during late July and early August, 1989. The average spectral reflectance and transmittance represent the mean values for the adaxial (top) and abaxial (bottom) sides of 4 - 10 leaves for wavelengths between 400 - 1050 nm at approximately 3 nm intervals.",
