    "description": "ABSTRACT: The leaf spectra datasets contain visible and near infrared reflectance spectra data for both fresh and dry leaf samples collected in the ACCP. These samples are from Blackhawk Island, WI, Harvard Forest, MA, Howland, ME, Jasper Ridge, CA field sites and the Douglas fir and bigleaf maple seedling canopy study sites. Data reported for each sample is absorbance [log(1/Reflectance)] from 400-2498nm at 2nm intervals and a resolution of 10nm. These data were collected for the purpose of determining the relationship of foliar chemical concentrations with visible and near infrared wavelength reflectance spectra.. Both multiple linear regression and partial least square regression techniques have been used to relate lab chemistry data to spectral reflectance. ORNL DAAC maintains information on the entire ACCP.",
