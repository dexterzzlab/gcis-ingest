    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set provides measurements for soil nutrients from areas that were selectively logged and from control areas in the Tapajos National Forest, Para Western Santarem, Brazil. Data are included for calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), magnesium (Mg), nitrogen (N), aluminum (Al), iron (Fe), silicon (Si), carbon 13, nitrogen 15, and potassium (K) concentrations. In addition, data are included for Phosphorus fractionation which was performed on a subset of the soils, and soil bulk density measurements. The samples were from clay-dominated (oxisols) soils.",
