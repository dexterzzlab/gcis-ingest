    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set reports eddy flux measurements of CO2 and H2O exchange and associated meteorological measurements at the Para Western (Santarem) - km 67, Primary Forest Tower Site. This site is in the Tapajos National Forest located in north central Brazil. Measurements extend from January 2002 through January 2006.Eddy fluxes of CO2 and H2O were measured at two levels (58m and 47m) using tower-mounted closed-path Licor 6262 gas analyzers and Campbell CSAT3 sonic anemometers (Figure 1). Eddy-flux measurements were made at a sampling rate of 8 Hz and averaged over a 1 hour interval.. A comprehensive set of meteorological parameters (air temperature, pressure, PAR, net radiation, precipitation, etc) were also measured.Co-located measurements included a third Licor gas analyzer that measured (a) the CO2 and H2O concentration profiles at 8 levels in and above the canopy (1 level every 2 minutes) and (b) the instantaneous integrated canopy storage of CO2 and H2O, using a design that pulled air simultaneously through all 8 inlets (once every 20 minutes).
