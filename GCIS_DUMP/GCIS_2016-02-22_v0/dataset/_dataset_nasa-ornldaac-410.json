    "description": "ABSTRACT: The Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC) collected surface meteorological and radiation data from December, 1993 until Decemb er 1996. The data set is comprised of the Suite A (meteorological and energy balance measurements) and Suite B (diffuse sol ar and longwave measurements) components. Suite A measurements were taken at each of ten sites and suite B measurements were made at five of the suite A sites. These data cover an area of roughly 1000 km by 1000 km (a large portion of northern Man itoba and northern Saskatchewan). The measurement network was designed to provide researchers with a sufficient record of n ear-surface meteorological and radiation measurements.",
