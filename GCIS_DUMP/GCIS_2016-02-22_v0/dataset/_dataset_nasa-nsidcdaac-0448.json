    "description": "Notice to Data Users: The documentation for this data set was provided solely by the Principal Investigator(s) and was not further developed, thoroughly reviewed, or edited by NSIDC. Thus, support for this data set may be limited. This data set includes radar backscatter data collected over the Soil Moisture Experiment 2005 (SMEX05) area of Iowa, USA from 01 May 2005 through 31 July 2005. The SeaWinds scatterometer on the NASA Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) satellite collected backscatter data. The total volume of this data set is approximately 18 megabytes. Data are provided in gzip compressed Brigham Young University - Microwave Earth Remote Sensing (BYU-MERS) Scatterometer Image Reconstruction (SIR) images and Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) images, and are available via FTP. The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) is a mission instrument launched aboard NASA's Aqua satellite on 04 May 2002. AMSR-E validation studies linked to SMEX are designed to evaluate the accuracy of AMSR-E soil moisture data. Specific validation objectives include: assessing and refining soil moisture algorithm performance; verifying soil moisture estimation accuracy; investigating the effects of vegetation, surface temperature, topography, and soil texture on soil moisture accuracy; and determining the regions that are useful for AMSR-E soil moisture measurements.",
