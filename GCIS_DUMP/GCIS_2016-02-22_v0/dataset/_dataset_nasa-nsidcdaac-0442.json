    "description": "Notice to Data Users: The documentation for this data set was provided solely by the Principal Investigator(s) and was not further developed, thoroughly reviewed, or edited by NSIDC. Thus, support for this data set may be limited. This data set combines data for several parameters measured in the Walnut Creek watershed located in Iowa, USA for the Soil Moisture Experiment 2005 (SMEX05). The parameters include gravimetric and volumetric soil moisture, bulk density, and surface and soil temperature. The data were collected from 15 June 2005 through 03 July 2005 using in situ manual sampling, pyrometers, temperature probes, and theta probes. The total volume of this data set is approximately 1 MB. Data are provided in ASCII text files and are available via FTP. The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) is a mission instrument launched aboard NASA's Aqua satellite on 04 May 2002. AMSR-E validation studies linked to SMEX are designed to evaluate the accuracy of AMSR-E soil moisture data. Specific validation objectives include: assessing and refining soil moisture algorithm performance; verifying soil moisture estimation accuracy; investigating the effects of vegetation, surface temperature, topography, and soil texture on soil moisture accuracy; and determining the regions that are useful for AMSR-E soil moisture measurements.",
