    "description": "This data set provides the results of predictive modeling experiments on the Amundsen Sea Embayment region of Antarctica. The models examine how interactions between basal processes and ice sheet dynamics can result in abrupt reconfigurations of ice-sheets, and how those reconfigurations impact other Earth systems. The models were developed by a collaborative effort called the Community Ice Sheet Model (CISM). The data set contains a MATLAB (.mat) native format file with time evolution of basal temperature fields from a generic ice sheet model with uniform and non-uniform heat flux, a MATLAB script for performing singular value decomposition and analysis of the model fields, and a summary of experimental results in Portable Document Format (.pdf). Data are available via FTP.",
