    "description": "ABSTRACT: The NOAA Radiosonde Observations Data Set contains data that were extracted from the NOAA operational analysis system and transmitted to the FIS. Data are available from July 1985 to October 1988, there are 1123 days of data during this period with data at twelve hour intervals. These data were collected using sondes released in Dodge City and Topeka, Kansas, 337 km and 68 km, respectively, from the FIFE site. Radiosonde observations were made to determine the pressure, temperature, and humidity from the surface to the point where the sounding was terminated.",
