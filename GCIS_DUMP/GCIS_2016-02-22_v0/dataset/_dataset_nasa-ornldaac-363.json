    "description": "ABSTRACT: The BOREAS TF-04 team measured distributions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) concentrations for the upper 5 meters of soil and unsaturated zone at the mature stand, upper 6 m at the 20-year old stand, and the upper 1m at the 8-year old stand and clear cut area at the Southern Study Area of the Boreal Ecosystem Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) during August 1993 to March 1995. Particle size and carbon content of the unsaturated deposits, precipitation, soil temperature and moisture, carbon and oxygen isotopes of soil CO2 and soil water chemistry are also presented.",
