    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set provides fractional land cover type images for shade, green vegetation (GV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), and soil for the regions of JiParana, PortoVelho, Luiza, Ariquemes, and Cacoal in the state of Rondonia, Brazil, for the period 1984 to 2000. The images were derived with a spectral mixture analysis (SMA) of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) time series scenes for each of these areas. There were 249 TM scenes and one Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) scene acquired for these analyses. The images are 30-m Landsat resolution and were georectified to the Brazilian space agency 1998 and 1999 PRODES imagery. There are 250 GeoTIIF image files (*.tif) in this data set. Files are grouped by region and year/month/day scene was taken.",
