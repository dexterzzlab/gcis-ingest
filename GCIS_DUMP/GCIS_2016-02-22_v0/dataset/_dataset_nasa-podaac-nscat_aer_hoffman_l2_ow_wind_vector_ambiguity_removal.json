    "description": "This dataset contains the NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT) Level 2 ocean wind vector ambiguity overlay files for the NSCAT MGDR version 2 dataset, referenced for 25 km wind vector cells (WVC). The dataset is derived from the results of a study which used a 2-D variational analysis method (VAM) to select a wind solution from the NSCAT ambiguous winds (Hoffman et al. 2003). Hoffman et al. chose the ambiguity closest in direction to the VAM surface wind analysis. No ambiguity was chosen for poor quality wind vector cells (WVCs). ECMWF analyses were used as the background field for the VAM. Their choice of ambiguity selection is compared with that of JPL, which used a median filter initialized with NCEP analysis fields. Ambiguity selection is changed in ~5% of the dataset, often improving the depiction of meteorological features where the surface wind is strongly curved or sheared. See Hoffman et al. (2003) for more on the method and results. Additional work by Henderson et al. (2003) compares the results of median filtering (JPL) vs. the 2d-VAR method (Hoffman et al., 2003) using 51 days of NSCAT data, supplemented by the NCEP 1000 hPa wind analyses as background fields.",
