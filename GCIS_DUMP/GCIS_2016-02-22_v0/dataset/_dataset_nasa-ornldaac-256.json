    "description": "ABSTRACT: The surface meteorological data collected at the BOREAS tower and ancillary sites are being used as inputs to an energy balance model to monitor the amount of snow storage in the boreal forest region. The BOREAS HYD-02 team used snow water equivalent (SWE) derived from an energy balance model and in situ observed SWE to compare the SWE inferred from airborne and spaceborne microwave data, and to assess the accuracy of microwave retrieval algorithms. The major external measurements that are needed are snowpack temperature profiles, and in situ snow areal extent and snow water equivalent data. The data in this data set were collected during February 1994 and cover portions of the SSA, NSA, and the transect areas.",
