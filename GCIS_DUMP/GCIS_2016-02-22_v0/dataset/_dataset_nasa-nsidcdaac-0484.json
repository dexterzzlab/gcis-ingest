    "description": "This data set (NSIDC-0484), part of the NASA Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) Program, provides the first comprehensive, high-resolution, digital mosaics of ice motion in Antarctica assembled from multiple satellite interferometric synthetic-aperture radar systems. The majority of the data were acquired during the International Polar Year 2007 to 2009. Additional data were utilized as needed to maximize coverage. Mosaics are available at 450 m and 900 m spacings. <strong>Note:</strong> These data are considered provisional pending a review by the MEaSUREs program. Once the data have been reviewed, this statement will be removed from this documentation.",
