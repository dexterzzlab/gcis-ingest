    "description": "This data set contains vertical, cross body, and along body acceleration values for geophysical survey flights in Antarctica using the ZLS Dynamic Gravity Meter. The data were collected by scientists working on the International Collaborative Exploration of the Cryosphere through Airborne Profiling (ICECAP) project, which was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Collaborative Research Center, and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) with additional support from NASA Operation IceBridge.",
