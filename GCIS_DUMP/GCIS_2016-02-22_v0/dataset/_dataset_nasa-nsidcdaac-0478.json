    "description": "This data set, part of the NASA Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) program, provides annual ice-sheet-wide velocity maps for Greenland, derived using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data from the RADARSAT-1 satellite. The data set currently contains ice velocity data for the winter of 2000-2001 and 2005-2006, 2006-2007, and 2007-2008 acquired from RADARSAT-1 InSAR data from the Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF), and a 2008-2009 mosaic derived from the Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) and TerraSAR-X data. <strong>Note</strong>: Although this data set has been screened for anomalously large errors, at this stage they are Version 1 and some significant errors may persist (>20 m/yr). In addition, these data are considered provisional pending a review by the MEaSUREs program. Once the data have been reviewed, this statement will be removed.",
