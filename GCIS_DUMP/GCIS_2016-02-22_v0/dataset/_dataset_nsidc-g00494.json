    "description": "The collection consists of approximately 50,000 high-quality negatives and transparencies showing ice cover impact on navigation or hydroelectric operation from 1963 to 1973. Coverage is not systematic or complete. Indexing has not been undertaken, but latitude and longitude of flight line begin and end points are logged. Photos from many flights have been made into photomosaics that can be used on-site as a gross index to the 9-inch roll negatives. Photographic flights were carried out by a U.S. Air Force photomapping wing, using flight lines selected by NOAA Lake Survey Center (now Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory). The collection is available for on-site use only by appointment.",
