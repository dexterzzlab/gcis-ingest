    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set contains topographic/geomorphological data associated with the four Intensive Study Areas (ISAs) in the Northern Ecuadorian Amazon (northern Oriente) that are part of the University of North Carolina's Carolina Population Center (CPC) Ecuador Projects study. Study area boundaries were developed directly from 1:50,000 topographical maps. Point elevation features and 20-meter elevation contours were digitized from these same maps. Digital elevation models (DEMs) were derived from these elevation data and, in turn, terrain aspect and terrain slope were derived from the digital elevation models. Only boundary data were provided for the southwestern ISA. These data are provided in ESRI shapefile format and GeoTiff. There are six compressed (*.zip) data files with this data set.",
