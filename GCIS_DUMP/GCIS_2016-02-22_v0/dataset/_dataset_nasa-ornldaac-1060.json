    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set reports the results of measurements of (1) leaf-level photosynthesis response curves for the effects of temperature, leaf age, warming, irradiation, and circadian rhythm and (2) leaf-level photorespiration rates at 30 and 37 degrees C. Measurements were made between June 2000 and February 2006 at the km 83 Logged Forest Tower site, the km 67 Primary Forest Tower site, and the control site at Seca Floresta, all in the Tapajos National Forest, Para, Brazil. There are 7 comma delimited ASCII data files with this data set.",
