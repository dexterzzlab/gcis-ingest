    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set contains estimates of understory fuel loads (forest litter) at six locations near Paragominas in Northeastern Amazonia. Samples were collected from three different forest conditions: primary forest, logged forest, and burned forest. Volumes and weights are provided by size and condition class based on the planar transect method of estimating understory fuel loads (Brown 1971). Means and standard errors are reported from 3 transects in each forest x condition class. There is one comma-delimited data file (.csv) with this data set. DATA QUALITY STATEMENT: The Data Center has determined that there are questions about the quality of the data reported in this data set. The data set has missing or incomplete data, metadata, or other documentation that diminishes the usability of the products.",
