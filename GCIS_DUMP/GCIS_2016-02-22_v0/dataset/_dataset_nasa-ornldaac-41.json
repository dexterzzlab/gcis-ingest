    "description": "ABSTRACT: The purpose of the Leaf Area Index and PAR Determined from KSU Light Bar Measurements study was to collect extensive non-destructive measurements of Leaf Area Index (LAI) at the flux sites during IFC-5 (August 1989). These data were collected at thirteen locations which were coincident with the surface flux measurements within the FIFE study area from July 3, 1989 through August 18, 1989. The various fractions of the Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) (i.e., diffuse, reflected, transmitted and total) were measured using a Line Quantum meter from LI-COR Inc. From these fractions the ratio of reflected to total incoming PAR was computed. LAI can be estimated from light bar measurements of PAR transmittance from measurements above and below a vegetation canopy. The use of the light bar allows rapid, multiple, and repeatable measurements of LAI at the FIFE sites. This type of measurements could not be done using destructive measurements of LAI.",
