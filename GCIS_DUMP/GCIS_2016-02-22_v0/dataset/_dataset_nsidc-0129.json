    "description": "This data set is part of the WAISCORES project, an NSF-funded project to understand the influence of the West Antarctic ice sheet on climate and sea level change. WAISCORES researchers acquired and analyzed ice cores from the Siple Dome, in the Siple Coast region, West Antarctica. Lamorey measured the density of the shallow Siple Dome cores B - I. One-meter sections of the ice core were weighed on a balance beam in the field. The volume was determined by measuring the diameter and length of the core. The data consists of tab-delimited text files of density measurements and a sonic velocity profile, and a .gif format density-versus-depth plot. Data are available via FTP.",
