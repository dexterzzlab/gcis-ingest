    "description": "Daily ice motion vectors are computed from a wide variety of sensors ranging from passive microwave radiometers, such as the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), to International Arctic Buoy Programme (IABP) buoy data. Daily gridded fields combine data from all sensors, from November 1978 through December 2012. Grids extend from 48.4&deg; N to 90&deg; N, and from 53.2&deg; S to 90&deg; S. Mean gridded fields include yearly, monthly, and weekly means, and a mean for the entire time series. Both daily and mean gridded fields are in 2-byte integer format, reprojected to 25 km Northern and Southern Hemisphere EASE-Grids. Browse images of mean fields are available in Portable Network Graphics (PNG) and Postscript (PS) formats. Raw ice motion vectors from each sensor are in tab-delimited ASCII text format. The complete data set is available via FTP.",
