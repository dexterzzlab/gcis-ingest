    "description": "Notice to Data Users: The documentation for this data set was provided solely by the Principal Investigator(s) and was not further developed, thoroughly reviewed, or edited by NSIDC. Thus, support for this data set may be limited. This data set is comprised of in situ Multispectral Radiometer (MSR) data collected over the Soil Moisture Experiment 2004 (SMEX04) area of southern Arizona, USA between 29 July and 25 August 2004. Surface reflectance was measured multiple times on various days during the study period in a variety of sampling sites. Transect sampling was also conducted on a weekly basis to coincide with Landsat and ASTER satellite overpasses. The total volume for this data set is approximately 520 KB. Raw data and field average data are provided in an ASCII tab-delimited text files, and are available via FTP. These data were collected as part of a validation study for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). AMSR-E is a mission instrument launched aboard NASA's Aqua Satellite on 04 May 2002. AMSR-E validation studies linked to SMEX are designed to evaluate the accuracy of AMSR-E soil moisture data. Specific validation objectives include assessing and refining soil moisture algorithm performance; verifying soil moisture estimation accuracy; investigating the effects of vegetation, surface temperature, topography, and soil texture on soil moisture accuracy; and determining the regions that are useful for AMSR-E soil moisture measurements.",
