    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set describes select global soil parameters from the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) v1.2, including additional calculated parameters such as area weighted soil organic carbon (kg C per m2), as high resolution NetCDF files. These data were regridded and upscaled from the Harmonized World Soil Database v1.2 The HWSD provides information for addressing emerging problems of land competition for food production, bio-energy demand and threats to biodiversity and can be used as input to model global carbon cycles. The data are presented as a series of 27 NetCDF v3/v4 (*.nc4) files at 0.05-degree spatial resolution, and one NetCDF file regridded to the Community Land Model (CLM) grid cell resolution (0.9 degree x 1.25 degree) for the nominal year of 2000.",
