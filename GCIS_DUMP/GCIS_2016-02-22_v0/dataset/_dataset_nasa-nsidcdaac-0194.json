    "description": "The Wakasa Bay Field Campaign was conducted in January and February 2003 to validate rainfall algorithms developed for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). The primary objective was to validate both AMSR and AMSR-E shallow rainfall and snowfall retrievals. An Airborne Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (AMMR) aboard a NASA P-3 Orion collected 37 GHz and 21 GHz brightness temperatures (TBs) and air temperatures on 14 January, 19 January, 21 January, and 03 February 2003. All measurements fall within 30.6763 deg N to 41.476 deg N, 134.0313 deg E to 150.3528 deg E. Data are in tab-delimited ASCII text format and are available via FTP.",
