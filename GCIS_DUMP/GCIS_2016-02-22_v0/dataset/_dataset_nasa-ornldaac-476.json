    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set contains ten ASCII files (.txt format), one NPP file for each of the nine different montane tropical rainforest sites within the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) of Puerto Rico and one file containing climate data. The NPP study sites are located along an environmental gradient of different soils, elevation (100-1,000 m), develop stage, and mean annual rainfall. Field measurements were carried out from 1946 through 1994. Estimates of above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) in LEF are based on summation of litterfall accumulation, biomass increment, and herbivory estimates. ANPP values range from 370-1,950 g/m2/year, with ANPP decreasing with elevation. The lowest ANPP was in the Dwarf cloud rainforest. The Palm floodplain and Bisley (tabonuco) forests have the highest ANPP (1,950 g/m2/year and 1,630 g/m2/year, respectively). Below-ground NPP was measured at only two of the sites (Guzman and Bisley) and was estimated for the Dwarf site. TNPP estimates for these sites are 1,945, 2,160, and 383 g/m2/year, respectively. Climate data are available from a weather station at the El Verde forest study site.",
