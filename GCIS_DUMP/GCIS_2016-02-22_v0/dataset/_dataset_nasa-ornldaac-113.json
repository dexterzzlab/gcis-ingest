    "description": "ABSTRACT: The aim of the FIFE soil moisture transect work was to characterize spatial and temporal patterns of soil moisture along selected transects at the FIFE study area. Two levels of ground data were collected to support the passive microwave (PBMR) flights over the Konza experimental area. The water content measurements were collected using gravimetric methods. Soil moisture measured along a transect is necessary to calibrate airborne moisture instruments or compare data obtained from them. Soil units in a landscape are inherently heterogeneous, which leads to variations in moisture content along an aircraft flight path on the ground. In order to reduce errors, values on the flight path were sampled at close intervals.",
