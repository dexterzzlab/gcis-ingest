    "description": "The NASA IceBridge GPS/IMU L1B Primary Position and Attitude Solution (IPUTG1B) data set contains elevation, roll, pitch, heading, north-south acceleration, east-west acceleration, and vertical acceleration measurements over Antarctica using the Systron and Donner MMQ-50 Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and the Topcon GB-1000 GPS+ receiver. The data were collected by scientists working on the Investigating the Cryospheric Evolution of the Central Antarctic Plate (ICECAP) project, which is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) with additional support from NASA Operation IceBridge. The data are stored in ASCII text format and are available via FTP for periodic, ongoing campaigns from 12 December 2010 to the present.",
