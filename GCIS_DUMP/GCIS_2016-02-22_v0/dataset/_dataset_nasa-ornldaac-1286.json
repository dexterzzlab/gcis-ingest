    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set provides multiple-return LiDAR-derived vegetation canopy structure and their spatial distribution at 30-meter spatial resolution for the Tennessee part of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP). Canopy characteristics were analyzed using high resolution three-dimensional point cloud data sets gathered between February and April 2011. Vegetation types were mapped by grouping areas of similar canopy structure. The map was compared and validated against existing vegetation maps for the Park.",
