    "description": "Notice to Data Users: The documentation for this data set was provided solely by the Principal Investigator(s) and was not further developed, thoroughly reviewed, or edited by NSIDC. Thus, support for this data set may be limited. This data set consists of Vegetation Water Content (VWC) data for two Soil Moisture Experiment 2004 (SMEX04) regional study areas: Arizona, USA and Sonora, Mexico. VWC was derived from the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII) which was obtained from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery on 29 July 2004 and 30 August 2004. From these overpass images, daily images were generated by linearly interpolating each scene between the nearest available scenes. Individual data values must be divided by 100 to obtain the actual vegetation water content in kg/m2. The total volume for this data set is approximately 3.2 gigabytes. Data are provided as binary files and are available via FTP. These data were collected as part of a validation study for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). AMSR-E is a mission instrument launched aboard NASA's Aqua Satellite on 04 May 2002. AMSR-E validation studies linked to SMEX are designed to evaluate the accuracy of AMSR-E soil moisture data. Specific validation objectives include assessing and refining soil moisture algorithm performance; verifying soil moisture estimation accuracy; investigating the effects of vegetation, surface temperature, topography, and soil texture on soil moisture accuracy; and determining the regions that are useful for AMSR-E soil moisture measurements.",
