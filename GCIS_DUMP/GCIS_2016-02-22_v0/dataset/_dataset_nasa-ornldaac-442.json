    "description": "ABSTRACT: The BOREAS RSS-07 team focused their efforts on developing and validating procedures and algorithms that would allow the retrieval of LAI from remotely sensed vegetation indices. This data set contains images of LAI and FPAR that were produced from the AVHRR Level-4c ten-day composite NDVI images produced at CCRS for the three summer IFCs in 1994. The algorithms were developed based on ground measurements and Landsat TM images (Chen and Cihlar, 1996; Chen, 1996b). The data are provided in binary image format files. Companion files include example thumbnail images that may be viewed and the image data files downloaded using a convenient viewer utility.",
