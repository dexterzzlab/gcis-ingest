    "description": "ABSTRACT: The RADAMBRASIL project extensively mapped the Amazon soils using a combination of soil pit information, aerial photography, and geologic maps. During the project, 1,153 soil pits, distributed basin-wide, were described and sampled by horizon and analyzed for texture and chemical composition. This data set, which consists of one file in ASCII comma separated format, contains soil profile descriptions for locations throughout Brazilian Amazonia. These data are based on RADAMBRASIL surveys from the Soil Profiles of Amazonia (Source: IPAM, Brazil/WHRC, USA). See the companion file Soil Profiles of Amazonia.pdf",
