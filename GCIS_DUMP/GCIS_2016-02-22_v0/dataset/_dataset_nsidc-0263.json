    "description": "This product, based on prior data collected under NSF-OPP grant 8716604 (Echelmeyer and Harrison) and NSF-OPP grant 9117911 (Harrison), includes ice velocity data between stations S17 and UpB on the Upper Whillans Ice Stream, Siple Coast, West Antarctica, from January 1994 to January 1995. Velocities were measured using a total station, a surveying instrument that combines a digital theodolite and an Electronic Distance Measuring (EDM) device to measure horizontal and vertical angles, slope, and horizontal and vertical distances. Data are in ASCII and Excel formats, and are available via FTP.",
