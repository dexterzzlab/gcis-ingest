    "description": "ABSTRACT: Leaf area index was estimated in an 18 ha plot at the logged forest tower site, km 83, Tapajos National Forest, Para, Brazil. The plot was adjacent to the eddy flux tower at km 83, Tapajos National Forest, Para, Brazil. Thirty litter traps were placed at 25-m intervals along two east&#226;&#128;&#147;west transects in the 18 ha block. Litter samples were collected biweekly from the traps and returned to the lab where they were sorted, air dried, and weighed. The leaf area of a subsample of air-dried leaves was determined using a computer scanner and image processing software. The subsample was then dried in an oven and the air-dried weights were corrected to oven-dried weight. The area of leaf litter collected during each sampling was calculated using the relationship between weight and area measured for the subsample (Goulden et al., 2004). There is one comma-delimited data file with this data set.",
