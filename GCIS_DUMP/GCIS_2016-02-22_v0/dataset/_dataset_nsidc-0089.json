    "description": "Major ion concentration values (Na, Mg, Ca, Cl, NO3, SO4, MSA) were analyzed from a 20-meter ice core drilled in Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica (location - 65 01' East, 75 00' South, elevation - 2,900 m a.s.l.). The core was drilled during the austral summer 1991-1992. Major ion analysis was by ion chromatography. The anions were analyzed on a Dionex AS4A column; the cations on a Dionex CS12 column and MSA on a Dionex AS4 column. All used suppressed chromatography. Using established protocols to prevent contamination, the core was processed into 3-centimeter pieces by the Glacier Research Group at the University of New Hampshire's Climate Change Research Center. The 3-cm pieces were kept frozen until major ion analysis.",
