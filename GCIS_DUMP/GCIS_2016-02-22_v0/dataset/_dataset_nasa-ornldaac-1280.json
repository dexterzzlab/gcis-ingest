    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set provides ~100-m resolution image mosaics of South America acquired during the low flood season between September and December 1995 and during the high flood season between May and July of 1996. The images cover the same areas during both seasons and were obtained from the Japanese Earth Resources Satellite 1 (JERS-1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) of the National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA). The data were mosaicked into 34 tiles for each season, each consisting of about 50 JERS-1 scenes. This data set constitutes the first-ever high-resolution and single season coverage of the entire Amazon River Basin, made possible by the cloud penetrating properties of the radar sensor. The images are from the original JERS-1 SAR Global Rain Forest Mapping Project. This data set contains 66 files in GeoTIFF (.tiff) format. There are 32 files for the low flood season and 34 files for the high flood season.",
