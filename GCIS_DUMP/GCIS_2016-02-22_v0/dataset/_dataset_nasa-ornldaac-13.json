    "description": "ABSTRACT: The NOAA Radiosonde Observations - 1989 (NCDC) Data Set contains radiosonde data obtained from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). These 396 days of data cover 13 months from October 1988 through October 1989. These data were collected using sondes released in Dodge City and Topeka Kansas, 337 km and 68 km, respectively, from the FIFE study area. Radiosonde observations were made to determine the pressure, temperature, and humidity from the surface to the point where the sounding was terminated. It is assumed that the use of these data is applicable to the FIFE study because these meteorological data are relatively stable in the horizontal domain. These data may be used as input to numerical models, as well as verification data for simulation studies.",
