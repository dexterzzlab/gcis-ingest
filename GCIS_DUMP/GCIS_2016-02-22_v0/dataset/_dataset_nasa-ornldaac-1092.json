    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set provides hot pixel data, as an indicator of fires that were detected by the GOES-8 satellite for the state of Acre, Brazil. Image data were collected for extended periods over the course of 3 years (1998, 2000 and 2001). Data were filtered to select only pixels identified and processed by the GOES-8 Automated Biomass Burning Algorithm (ABBA), where estimates of sub-pixel fire characteristics including size and temperature were able to be determined. There are three comma-delimited ASCII data files with this data set.",
