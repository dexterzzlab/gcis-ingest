    "description": "This data set includes ice flow velocities and strain configurations, from GPS measurements on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide. Ninety markers installed in the firn were measured during two consecutive field seasons running from 2005-2006 and 2006-2007. The markers were located in 150 by 60 km area, with smaller clusters of five markers located within about 10 km of each other. Consecutive GPS measurements were used to derive velocity for each marker. Strain configurations were estimated by differentiating a linear fit of the data at each marker cluster. Data are available via FTP as ASCII text (.txt ) files in comma separated value format.",
