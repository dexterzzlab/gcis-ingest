    "description": "ABSTRACT: The BOREAS TF-11 team collected several data sets in their efforts to fully describe the flux and site characteristics at the SSA-Fen site. This data set contains temperature, pH, and concentration profiles of methane and carbon dioxide within the surface 50 cm of peat. The measurements were conducted as part of a 2x2 factorial experiment in which we added carbon (300 g m-2 as wheat straw) and nitrogen (6 g m-2 as urea) to four replicate locations in the vicinity of the TF-11 tower. The data set covers the period from the first week of June 1994 through the second week of September, 1994.",
