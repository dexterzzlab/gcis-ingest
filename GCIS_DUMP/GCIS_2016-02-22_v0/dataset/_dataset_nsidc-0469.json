    "description": "This data set includes estimates of the location of the grounding zone of Antarctic ice shelves based on laser altimeter data acquired during the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) mission, October 2003 through October 2009. The estimates are based on ICESat repeat-track analysis, which can be used to detect the region of ice flexure across the grounding line, since each repeated pass is acquired at a different tidal phase. The technique provides estimates for the landward limit of flexure, the point where the ice becomes hydrostatically balanced, and the break-in-slope associated with the flexure. Data files are available via FTP in ASCII text (.txt) format.",
