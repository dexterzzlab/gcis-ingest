The Social Vulnerability Index provides a quantitative, integrative measure for comparing the degree of vulnerability of human populations across the nation. A high SoVI (dark pink) typically indicates some combination of high exposure and high sensitivity to the effects of climate change and low capacity to deal with them. Specific index components and weighting are unique to each region (North Atlantic, South Atlantic, Gulf, Pacific, Great Lakes, Alaska, and Hawai\u2018i). All index components are constructed from readily available Census data and include measures of poverty, age, family structure, location (rural versus urban), foreign-born status, wealth, gender, Native American status, and occupation.<tbib>8b9be5aa-a391-4ed6-a26e-20959b4417ac</tbib><sup>,</sup><tbib>8f692a8f-1867-45fc-bdd6-e66772049cc8</tbib>\r\n\r\n\r\nRegional Differences: Regional threats from climate change are compiled from technical input reports, the regional chapters in this report, and from scientific literature.
