This data, derived from the CMIP5 archive, is as presented in figure 1 of Kharin et al. (2013). The following models were used:\r\nbcc-csm1-1, BNU-ESM, CanESM2, CCSM4, CESM1-CAM5, CNRM-CM5, CSIRO-Mk3-6-0, EC-EARTH, FGOALS-g2, FGOALS-s2, FIO-ESM, GFDL-CM3, GFDL-ESM2G, GFDL-ESM2M, GISS-E2-R, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-ES, IPSL-CM5A-LR, IPSL-CM5A-MR, MIROC5, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, MIROC-ESM, MPI-ESM-LR, MPI-ESM-MR, MRI-CGCM3, NorESM1-ME, and NorESM1-M.\r\n2. The present return period (by definition 20 years) is divided by the projected future return periods for RCP2.6.\r\n3. These data were plotted for the United States.",
