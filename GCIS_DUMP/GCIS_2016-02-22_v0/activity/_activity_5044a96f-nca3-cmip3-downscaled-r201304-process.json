At each grid point, the mean frost-free season length for the two time periods was computed by averaging the following models:\r\n- cgcm3_t47\r\n- cgcm3_t63\r\n- cnrm\r\n- echam5\r\n- echo\r\n- gfdl_2.1\r\n- hadcm3\r\n- pcm\r\n3. At each grid point, the difference in frost-free season length was calculated for 2070-2099 minus 1971-2000.\r\n4. Data were plotted for grid points that experienced 20 or more years with at least one frost during 1971-2000.",
