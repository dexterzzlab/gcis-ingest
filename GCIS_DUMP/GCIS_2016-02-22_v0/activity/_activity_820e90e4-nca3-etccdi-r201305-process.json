For each model listed below, at each grid point, the mean annual maximum number of consecutive dry days was calculated for two periods (1971-2000 and 2070-2099) by averaging the annual values.\r\n3. Multi-model mean values were then calculated for 1971-2000 and 2070-2099 by averaging the period means from the 24 models listed below, at each grid point.\r\n4. The percentage change was calculated at each grid point (relative to the 1971-2000 mean) and plotted on a map.\r\n5. The percentage of models with differences greater than zero was calculated and stippling was added to the maps for percentages greater than 80% or less than 20%.\r\n\r\nThe following models were used:\r\nACCESS1-0\r\nBNU-E\r\nCanES2\r\nCCSM4\r\nCESM1-BGC\r\nCMCC-CM\r\nCNRM-CM5\r\nCSIRO-Mk3-6-0\r\nGFDL-CM3\r\nGFDL-ESM2G\r\nGFDL-ESM2M\r\nHadGEM2-CC\r\nHadGEM2-ES\r\ninmcm4\r\nIPSL-CM5A-LR\r\nIPSL-CM5A-MR\r\nIPSL-CM5B-LR\r\nMIROC5\r\nMIROC-ESM-CHEM\r\nMIROC-ESM\r\nMPI-ESM-LR\r\nMPI-ESM-MR\r\nMRI-CGCM3\r\nNorESM1-M",
