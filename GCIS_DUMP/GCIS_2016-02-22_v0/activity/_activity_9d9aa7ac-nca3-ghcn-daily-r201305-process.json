    "methodology": "First, GHCN-D stations with minimal (less than 10%) missing precipitation data were identified. For each station the 99th percentile threshold of daily precipitation was determined using the entire period of record. Next, the total precipitation falling on days exceeding the 99th percentile threshold was calculated for each year. Then, grid box average values were calculated for each year, by averaging the values for each station available in that grid box. The annual values were then averaged for all grid boxes containing data in the Northeast region. Decadal averages were then calculated. Finally the 1901-1960 99th percentile average amount was subtracted from the decadal average amount, and a percentage change was calculated.",
