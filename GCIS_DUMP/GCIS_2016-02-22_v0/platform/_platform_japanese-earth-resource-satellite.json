    "description": "JERS-1 (nickname of Fuyo-1) is a joint NASDA/MITI/STA [National Space Development Agency (Japan)/Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Japan)/Science and Technology Agency (Japan)] radar satellite project (NASDA/STA developed the satellite (built by Mitsubishi Electric Co.); MITI sponsored the instruments). The overall objectives call for: Generation of global data sets with SAR and OPS sensors in order to survey resources; establishing an integrated Earth observation system, verifying instrument/system performances. The mission applications focus on: survey of geological phenomena, land usage (agriculture, forestry), observation of coastal regions, geologic maps, environment, disaster monitoring, etc. The spacecraft carries two closely matched Earth observation sensors: the active SAR instrument and the passive OPS multispectral imager.",
