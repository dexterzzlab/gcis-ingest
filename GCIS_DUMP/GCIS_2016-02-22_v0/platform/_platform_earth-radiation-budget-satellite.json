    "description": "ERBS is a pioneering Earth radiation budget satellite mission within NASA's ERBE (Earth Radiation Budget Experiment) Research Program - a three-satellite mission, designed to investigate how energy from the sun is absorbed and re-emitted by the Earth. The ERBE payload, three identical sets of two instruments each, represent a new generation radiometer of NASA/LaRC, first flown on ERBS (launch Oct. 5, 1984), then on NOAA-9 (launch Dec. 12, 1984), and on NOAA-10 (launch Sept. 17, 1986).",
