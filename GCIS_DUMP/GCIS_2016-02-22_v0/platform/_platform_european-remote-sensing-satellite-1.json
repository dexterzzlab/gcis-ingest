    "description": "ERS is the first ESA program in Earth observation with the overall objectives to provide environmental monitoring in particular in the microwave spectrum (i.e., regular monitoring of land-surface and ocean-surface processes for change detection). Coverage of a broad range of disciplines and topics: Observation of oceans, polar ice, land ecology, geology, forestry, wave phenomena, bathymetry (water depth), atmospheric physics, meteorology, etc. Scientific research: PIPOR (Program for International Polar Ocean Research); PISP (Polar Ice Sheet Proposal). Demonstration of concept and technology for space and ground segments (performance and operational capability).",
