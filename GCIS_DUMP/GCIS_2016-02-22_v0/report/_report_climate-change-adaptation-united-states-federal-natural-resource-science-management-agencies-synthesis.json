    "summary": "This report documents progress to date in climate change adaptation by Federal natural resource science and management agencies and tribes, providing a baseline for measuring future accomplishments. For agencies with a mandate to manage public land and/or water, the report focuses on: (1) guiding documents (strategic plans, climate change science and adaptation plans, etc.); (2) education efforts (for employees, stakeholders and the public); (3) partnerships (collaborations with other agencies, organizations, and stakeholders); (4) vulnerability assessments (activities that evaluate sensitivity, exposure, and adaptive capacity of resources to climate change); and (5) adaptation planning (efforts aimed at reducing vulnerabilities and minimizing impacts on agency mission).For agencies that produce science relevant to natural resource management, the report describes programs related to climate change science and adaptation and education programs.",
