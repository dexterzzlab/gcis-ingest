It uses the criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management endorsed by the Montreal Process, of which the United States is a member country. The report also identifies data gaps and makes recommendations for next steps to move forward the state of the art for analysis of sustainable forest management in the United States. A supporting document, \"Data Report\u2014Technical Document Supporting the 2003 National Report on Sustainable Forests,\" is available at http://www.fs.fed.us/research/sustain/. Thus, this report represents a significant step forward in providing an analysis of data that is consistent and comparable with analysis of data by other Montreal Process countries.",
