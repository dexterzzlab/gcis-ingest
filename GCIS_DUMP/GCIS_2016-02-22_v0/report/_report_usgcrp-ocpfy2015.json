From collecting satellite observations and modeling near-term climate, to supporting adaptation in the Federal Government and building skills among informal educators, to delivering the National Climate Assessment and sustaining the Nation's assessment capacity, this plain-language report demonstrates USGCRP's reach across the spectrum of research, decision support, education, and communication.",
