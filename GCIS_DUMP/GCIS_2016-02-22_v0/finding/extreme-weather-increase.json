    "process": "Development of the key messages involved discussions of the lead authors and accompanying analyses conducted via one in-person meeting plus multiple teleconferences and email exchanges from February thru September 2012. The authors reviewed 80 technical inputs provided by the public, as well as other published literature, and applied their professional judgment. \r\nKey message development also involved the findings from four special workshops that related to the latest scientific understanding of climate extremes. Each workshop had a different theme related to climate extremes, had approximately 30 attendees (the CMIP5 meeting had more than 100), and the workshops resulted in a paper.<tbib>b91893b4-24a8-46ba-b09a-013d462caf1b</tbib> The first workshop was held in July 2011, titled Monitoring Changes in Extreme Storm Statistics: State of Knowledge.<tbib>b37557ac-ee97-4c28-98ca-4f1f1afe163b</tbib> The second was held in November 2011, titled Forum on Trends and Causes of Observed Changes in Heatwaves, Coldwaves, Floods, and Drought.<tbib>e15600d0-290f-44e2-9b58-9ffd295ee6d2</tbib> The third was held in January 2012, titled Forum on Trends in Extreme Winds, Waves, and Extratropical Storms along the Coasts.<tbib>596a7f1e-6ce5-4bdf-b144-d0715a7567bd</tbib> The fourth, the CMIP5 results workshop, was held in March 2012 in Hawai\u2018i, and resulted in an analysis of CMIP5 results relative to climate extremes in the United States.<tbib>b91893b4-24a8-46ba-b09a-013d462caf1b</tbib>\r\nThe Chapter Author Team\u2019s discussions were supported by targeted consultation with additional experts. Professional expertise and judgment led to determining \u201ckey vulnerabilities.\u201d A consensus-based approach was used for final key message selection.",

    "statement": "There have been changes in some types of extreme weather events over the last several decades. Heat waves have become more frequent and intense, especially in the West. Cold waves have become less frequent and intense across the nation. There have been regional trends in floods and droughts. Droughts in the Southwest and heat waves everywhere are projected to become more intense, and cold waves less intense everywhere.",
    "uncertainties": "The key uncertainty regarding projections of future drought is how soil moisture responds to precipitation changes and potential evaporation increases. Most studies indicate that many parts of the U.S. will experience drier soil conditions but the amount of that drying is uncertain.\r\nNatural variability is also an uncertainty affecting projections of extreme event occurrences in shorter timescales (several years to decades), but the changes due to human influence become larger relative to natural variability as the timescale lengthens. Stakeholders should view the occurrence of extreme events in the context of increasing probabilities due to climate change.\r\nContinuation of long term temperature and precipitation observations is critical to monitoring trends in extreme weather events.",
