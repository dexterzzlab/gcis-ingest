    "confidence": "Future changes in flood frequencies and intensities will depend on a complex combination of local to regional climatic influences, and the details of complex surface-hydrologic conditions in each catchment (for example, topography, land cover, and upstream management). Consequently, flood frequency changes may be neither simple nor regionally homogeneous, and basin by basin projections may need to be developed. Early results now appearing in the literature have most often projected intensifications of flood regimes, in large part as responses to projections of more intense storms and increasingly rainy (rather than snowy) storms in previously snow-dominated settings. Confidence in current estimates of future changes in flood frequencies and intensities is overall judged to be low.",

The author team met in Seattle, Washington, in May, 2012 for expert deliberation of draft key messages by the authors wherein each message was defended before the entire author team before this key message was selected for inclusion in the Chapter. These discussions were supported by targeted consultation with additional experts by the lead author of each message, and they were based on criteria that help define \u201ckey vulnerabilities.\u201d Key messages were further refined following input from the NCADAC report integration team and authors of Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate.",

    "uncertainties": "Important new evidence (cited above) confirmed many of the findings from the prior National Climate Assessment. <tbib>e251f590-177e-4ba6-8ed1-6f68b5e54c8a</tbib> \r\nLarge uncertainties remain in efforts to detect flood-statistic changes attributable to climate change, because a wide range of local factors (such as dams, land-use changes, river channelization) also affect flood regimes and can mask, or proxy for, climate change induced alterations. Furthermore, it is especially difficult to detect any kinds of trends in what are, by definition, rare and extreme events. Finally, the response of floods to climate changes are expected to be fairly idiosyncratic from basin to basin, because of the strong influences of within-storm variations and local, basin-scale topographic, soil and vegetation, and river network characteristics that influence the size and extent of flooding associated with any given storm or season <tbib>7ef83121-d51c-4bc5-b499-e00733fae338</tbib><sup>,</sup><tbib>3fec0e7f-bcdd-42a3-bf79-635bd6adb609</tbib><sup>,</sup><tbib>fcd12450-81ff-4322-8a50-09c0662512eb</tbib><sup>,</sup><tbib>a639de52-b0d2-4580-a27c-5039d036d210</tbib>. \r\nLarge uncertainties still exist as to how well climate models can represent and project future extremes of precipitation. This has \u2013 until recently \u2013 limited attempts to make specific projections of future flood frequencies by using climate model outputs directly or as direct inputs to hydrologic models. However, precipitation extremes are expected to intensify as the atmosphere warms, and many floods result from larger portions of catchment areas receiving rain as snowlines recede upward. As rain runs off more quickly than snowfall this results in increased flood potential; furthermore, occasional rain-on-snow events exacerbates this effect. This trend is broadly expected to increase in frequency under general warming trends, particularly in mountainous catchments <tbib>73760c11-7b97-4876-a24f-8fb54b01bca9</tbib><sup>,</sup><tbib>fb52dd18-06f2-4774-9262-b00501ff730d</tbib><sup>,</sup><tbib>9417de56-6893-4102-86b7-ad7da4e68b8e</tbib><sup>,</sup><tbib>59b1ce0d-27ed-4224-835a-666a4006d9e8</tbib><sup>,</sup><tbib>7dc6aae5-efaa-489a-807e-8b92e7bcd546</tbib>. Rising sea levels and projected increase in hurricane-associated storm intensity and rainfall rates provide first-principles bases for expecting intensified flood regimes in coastal settings (see Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate).",
