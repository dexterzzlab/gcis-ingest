Increased stratification reduces mixing, resulting in reduced oxygen in bottom waters. Deeper set-up of vertical thermal stratification in lakes and reservoirs may reduce or eliminate a bottom cold water zone; this coupled with lower oxygen concentration results in a degraded aquatic ecosystem. \r\nMajor precipitation events and resultant water flows increase watershed pollutant scour and thus increase pollutant loads <tbib>ff7bc276-83ee-4d2b-a388-5409d7da855f</tbib><sup>,</sup><tbib>ff8a2e57-a49d-4e8e-90b1-c09e73b014fe</tbib>.

The author team met in Seattle, Washington, in May, 2012 for expert deliberation of draft key messages by the authors wherein each message was defended before the entire author team before this key message was selected for inclusion in the Chapter. These discussions were supported by targeted consultation with additional experts by the lead author of each message, and they were based on criteria that help define \u201ckey vulnerabilities.\u201d Key messages were further refined following input from the NCADAC report integration team and authors of Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate.",

    "uncertainties": "It is unclear whether increasing floods and droughts cancel each other out with respect to long-term pollutant loads. \r\nIt is also uncertain whether the absolute temperature differential with depth will remain constant, even with overall lake and reservoir water temperature increases. Further, it is uncertain if greater mixing with depth will eliminate thermal stratification in shallow, previously stratified lakes. Although recent studies of Lake Tahoe provide an example of longer stratification seasons,<tbib>0bd9cfef-4cd5-4b20-b953-04ecad0bd71c</tbib> lakes in other settings and with other geometries may not exhibit the same response. \r\nMany factors influence stream water temperature, including air temperature, forest canopy cover, and ratio of baseflow to streamflow.
