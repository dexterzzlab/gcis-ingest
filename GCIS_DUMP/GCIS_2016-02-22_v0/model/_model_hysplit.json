    "description": "The HYSPLIT model is a complete system for computing simple air parcel trajectories to complex dispersion and deposition simulations. The initial development was a result of a joint effort between NOAA and Australia's Bureau of Meteorology. Recent upgrades include enhancements provided by a number of different contributors. Some new features include improved advection algorithms, updated stability and dispersion equations, continued improvements to the graphical user interface, and the option to include modules for chemical transformations. Without the additional dispersion modules, Hysplit computes the advection of a single pollutant particle, or simply its trajectory. The dispersion of a pollutant is calculated by assuming either puff or particle dispersion. In the puff model, puffs expand until they exceed the size of the meteorological grid cell (either horizontally or vertically) and then split into several new puffs, each with it's share of the pollutant mass. In the particle model, a fixed number of particles are advected about the model domain by the mean wind field and spread by a turbulent component. The model's default configuration assumes a 3-dimensional particle distribution (horizontal and vertical).",
