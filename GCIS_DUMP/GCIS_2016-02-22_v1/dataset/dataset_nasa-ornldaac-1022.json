    "description": "ABSTRACT: The EDGAR (Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research) database project is a comprehensive task carried out jointly by the National Institute for Public Health (RIVM) and the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) and stores global emission inventories of direct and indirect greenhouse gases from anthropogenic sources including halocarbons and aerosols both on a per country and region basis as well as on a grid (see http://www.rivm.nl/edgar/). For the ISLSCP Initiative II data collection, gridded global annual anthropogenic emissions for the greenhouse gases CO2, CH4, N2O are provided on a 1.0 degree by 1.0 degree grid for the years 1970, 1980, 1990, and 1995 and for the tropospheric ozone precursor gases CO, NOx, NMVOC (Non-Methane Volatile Organic Compounds) and SO2 for the years 1990 and 1995. There are 2 *.zip data files with this data set.",
