    "description": "This data set contains sublimation rate data from laboratory studies of snow. Parameters include flow rate, measured sublimation rate, and theoretical maximum sublimation rate. Data were collected in cold rooms at the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL), in Hanover, NH, during 2005 and 2006. The data were collected as part of a collaborative research project. The project aims to develop a quantitative understanding of the processes active in isotopic exchange between snow/firn and water vapor, which is important to Antarctic ice core interpretation. Data are available via FTP in Microsoft Excel (.xls) format.",
