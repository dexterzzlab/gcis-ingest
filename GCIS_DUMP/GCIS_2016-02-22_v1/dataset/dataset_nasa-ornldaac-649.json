    "description": "ABSTRACT: The data set consists of a southern African subset of the \"Global Soil Types, 0.5-Degree Grid (Modified Zobler)\" data set. Data files are provided in ASCII GRID format. A global data set of soil types is available at 0.5-degree latitude by 0.5-degree longitude resolution. There are 106 soil units, based on Zobler?s (1986) assessment of the FAO/UNESCO Soil Map of the World. This data set is a conversion of the Zobler 1-degree resolution version to a 0.5-degree resolution. The resolution of the data set was not actually increased. Rather, the 1-degree squares were divided into four 0.5-degree squares with the necessary adjustment of continental boundaries and islands.",
