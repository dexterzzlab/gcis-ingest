    "description": "ABSTRACT: These data were derived from the original DEMs produced by the BOREAS HYD-08 team. The original DEMs were in the UTM projection, while this product is projected in the AEAC projection (see Section 7 for further projection details). The pixel size of the data is 100 meters, which is appropriate for the 1:50,000- scale contours from which the DEMs were made. The original data were compiled from information available in the 1970s and 1980s. This data set covers the two MSAs that are contained within the SSA and the NSA.",
