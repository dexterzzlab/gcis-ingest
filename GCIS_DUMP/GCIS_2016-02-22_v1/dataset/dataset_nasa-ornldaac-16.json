    "description": "ABSTRACT: The TOVS data were acquired from NOAA/NESDIS to monitor atmospheric conditions that occurred over the FIFE study area during 1987. The TOVS data were obtained from NESDIS in the standard TOVS sounding product format containing atmospheric sounding data for NOAA-9 and NOAA-10 satellites over the FIFE study area. The TOVS sounding products information is derived from three sensors which measure the intensity of upwelling radiation in the various spectral intervals that occur at maxima over broad layers and depths of the atmosphere. These radiance measurements are processed into Earth-located, calibrated radiance values, \"clear\" radiances (radiances corrected for cloud effects and angle-of-view), estimates of water vapor in three atmospheric layers (converted to precipitable water in these layers), mean temperatures for selected atmospheric layers, tropopause height and temperature estimates, and geopotential thickness of selected atmospheric layers.",
