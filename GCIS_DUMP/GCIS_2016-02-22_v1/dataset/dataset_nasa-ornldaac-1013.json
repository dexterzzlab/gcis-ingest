    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set reports the results of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen isotopic analyses of soil, soil water, and N2O soil gas samples; total soil carbon and nitrogen concentrations; and soil texture and bulk density. Samples were collected from the km 83 Logged Forest Tower Site and the km 67 Seca-Floresta Site in the Tapajos National Forest (TNF) near Santarem, Para, Brazil. Soil samples were collected in July of 2000 and soil gas samples were collected in 2001 and 2002. Soil and gas samples were collected from various soil types at each site and from several depths in specially constructed pits. There is one comma-delimited ASCII data file with this data set.",
