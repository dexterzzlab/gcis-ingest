    "description": "ABSTRACT: This biomass density image covers almost the entire BOREAS SSA. The pixels for which biomass density is computed include areas that are in conifer land cover classes only. The biomass density values represent the amount of overstory biomass (i.e. tree biomass only) per unit area. It is derived from a Landsat-5 TM image collected on 02-Sep-1994. The technique that was used to create this image is very similar to the technique that was used to create the physical classification of the SSA. The data are provided in a binary image file format. Companion files include (1) an image inventory listing to inform users of the images that are available and (2) example thumbnail images.",
