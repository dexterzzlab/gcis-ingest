    "description": "This data set provides measurement of sea ice draft (m) and the movement of sea ice (cm/s) over the continental shelf of the Eastern Beaufort Sea. The data set spans April 1990 to September 2003. The data set was acquired to assist in determining the character and recurrence of ice features hazardous to offshore industrial activity, specifically for the exploitation of hydrocarbon reserves and the impact of climate variability and change on the Beaufort Sea ice regime. Observations were made using two types of self-contained Upward Looking Sonar (ULS) moored near the sea floor: an Ice Profiling Sonar (IPS) used to obtain ice draft data and an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) used to obtain the ice velocity data. The data are provided in ASCII text format and are available via FTP.",
