    "description": "ABSTRACT: Surface flux and micrometeorological measurements were collected at one site within the northwest quadrant near the center of the FIFE study area during all five of the Intensive Field Campaigns (four in 1987 and one in 1989). This site had historically been ungrazed but had recently been exposed to grazing. The station was capable of measuring the fluxes of net radiation, sensible heat and latent heat using an eddy correlation system. In addition, measurements of soil heat flux and several micrometeorological parameters were made.",
