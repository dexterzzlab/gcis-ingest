    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set provides active fire detection images and associated summary information derived from Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images for various locations in Brazilian Amazonia during 2001-2003. There are two image types: (1) GeoTiff images (masks) of active fire pixels, and (2) GeoTiff images (masks) of clustered active fire pixels where a distinct cluster identification number has been assigned to each individual group of contiguous active fire pixels. There are 122 GeoTiff format files of each type of fire mask; a total of 244 images. The spatial resolution of the fire mask images is 30 meters. ETM+ images were selected based on data quality, availability, as well as on the occurrence of vegetation fires. In addition to the two image types, there are also two types of fire pixel summary information provided in text files: (1) one file of active fire pixel summary information derived from the active fire pixel images, and (2) 122 files of clustered active fire pixel information derived from individual clustered fire pixel masks, each of which correspond to a clustered image.",
