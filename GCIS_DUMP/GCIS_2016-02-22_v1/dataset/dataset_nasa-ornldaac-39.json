    "description": "ABSTRACT: The FIFE Historic Daily Meteorology Data Data Set is one of the historical data sets used for the FIFE project. The data set contains data back to January, 1900. This data set was prepared for input into models, therefore, no leap days (February 29) are included. Daily weather observations of air temperature and precipitation were made by Kansas State University. The observations are made according to the procedures outlined by the National Weather Service (Anonymous 1989).",
