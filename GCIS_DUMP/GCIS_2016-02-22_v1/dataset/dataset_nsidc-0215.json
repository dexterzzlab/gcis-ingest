    "description": "This data set contains concentrations of soluble chemical species (ions) within a 120 m ice core retrieved at the South Pole station in 2001. The ice core was dated with annual resolution using annual layer counting. Investigators measured chemical species, ions, and volcanic deposits found in the cores. The analysis was conducted at South Dakota State University between 2001 and 2003. Data are available in Microsoft Excel or ASCII text format via FTP from NSIDC.",
