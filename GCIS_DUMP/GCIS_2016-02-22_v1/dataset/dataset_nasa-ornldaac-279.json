    "description": "ABSTRACT: These streamflow data were collected by the HYD-09 science team to support its research into meltwater supply to the soil during the spring melt period. These data were also collected for HYD-09's research into the evolution of soil moisture, evaporation, and runoff from the end of the snowmelt period through freeze up. Data were collected in the BOREAS SSA and NSA from April until October in 1994, 1995, and 1996. Gauges SW1 and NW1 were operated year-round; however, data may not be available for both gauges for all 3 years.",
