    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set contains half-hourly average CO mixing ratios measured from 2001/04/18 to 2003/08/29 in the old-growth upland forest at the Para Western (Santarem) - km 67, Primary Forest Tower Site. This site is in the Tapajos National Forest located in north central Brazil.CO concentrations were measured in air drawn from above the canopy top of tower (approx. 64 meters) using a TEI 48CTL instrument modified for increased stability and sensitivity. The sensor was frequently zeroed by passing ambient air over a CO oxidation catalyst. The span was checked 4 times daily by sampling calibration gases at 100 and 500 ppb. Time in the file is given in UTC (decimal date) at the start of each half hour interval.Associated meteorological parameters, CO2 concentrations and micrometerological fluxes are available in LBA-ECO CD-10 CO2 and H2O Eddy Flux Data at km 67 Tower Site, Tapajos National Forest.",
