    "description": "ABSTRACT: The SAIL (Scattering from Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves) model was combined with the Jasinski geometric model to simulate canopy spectral reflectance and absorption of photosynthetically active radiation for discontinuous canopies. This model is called the GeoSail model. Tree shapes are described by cylinders or cones distributed over a plane. Spectral reflectance and transmittance of trees are calculated from the SAIL model to determine the reflectance of the three components used in the geometric model: illuminated canopy, illuminated background, shadowed canopy, and shadowed background. The model code is Fortran, sample input and output data are provided in ASCII text files.",
