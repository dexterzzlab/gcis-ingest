    "description": "This data set includes the results of laboratory experiments examining the constitutive properties of subglacial till, under dynamic stressing. The data include the results of shear strain and stress experiments. Testing was carried out in a servo-controlled biaxial shear device under controlled temperature and stress conditions, allowing both sliding and microstructural processes to be studied in detail. Till samples were collected from Matanuska, Alaska and from Caesar till at the Laurentide Ice Sheet. The data are available via FTP in ASCII text format (.txt).",
