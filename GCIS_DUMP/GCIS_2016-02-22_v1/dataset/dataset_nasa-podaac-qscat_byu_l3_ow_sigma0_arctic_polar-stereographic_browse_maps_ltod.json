    "description": "This dataset contains polar-stereographic-gridded Sigma-0 retrievals over the Arctic Polar region from SeaWinds on QuikSCAT retrievals subsetted and averaged twice daily at the local time-of-day (LTOD); local times are approximately morning (00:00 to 08:00 local) and evening (16:00 to 24:00 local). The eight hour interval at each LTOD reference of morning vs. evening corresponds to the natural boundaries of time separation within the data at polar latitudes. Hence, morning and evening are used as approximations for the LTOD reference, where the actual LTOD may vary within the respective 8 hour interval. This dataset is generated using a Scatterometer Image Reconstruction (SIR) technique developed by Dr. David Long at Brigham Young University (BYU); the processed files are therefore known as SIR files. These SIR files were also used to generate a complimentary dataset of GIF images meant for browse purposes only and is available here: http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/QSCAT_BYU_L3_OW_SIGMA0_ARCTIC_POLAR-STEREOGRAPHIC_BROWSE_IMAGES_LTOD. The QuikSCAT scatterometer scans at two nominal incidence angles, 46 degrees and 54.1 degrees, corresponding to the inner and outer beams respectively. The inner beam is horizontally polarized while the outer beam is vertically polarized. The SIR files are separated according to polarization. For example, one SIR file for a particular day and LTOD will contain the gridded average Sigma-0 values for the horizontally polarized L1B retrievals, while the other will contain those from the vertically polarized L1B retrievals. This dataset is generated by the Scatterometer Climate Record Pathfinder (SCP) project at BYU.",
