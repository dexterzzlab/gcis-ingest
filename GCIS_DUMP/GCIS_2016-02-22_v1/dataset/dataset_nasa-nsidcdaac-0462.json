    "description": "The AMSR-E Wakasa Bay Field Campaign was conducted over Wakasa Bay, Japan, in January and February, 2003. The Wakasa Bay Field Campaign includes joint research observations, such as precipitation amount, pressure thickness, seal level pressure, and surface winds by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), the AMSR precipitation validation team, and the NASA AMSR-E team. This data set contains weather forecast maps that were generated by the United States Air Force and were used in flight planning during the field experiment. The total volume of this data set is approximately 5 megabytes. Maps are provided in Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) files and are available via FTP. The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) is a mission instrument launched aboard NASA's Aqua Satellite on 04 May 2002. AMSR-E validation studies linked to rainfall experiments are designed to evaluate the accuracy of AMSR-E precipitation data.",
