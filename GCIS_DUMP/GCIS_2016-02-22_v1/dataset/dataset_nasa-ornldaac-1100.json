    "description": "ABSTRACT: Data are reported for leaf water potential of leaves of seven species of trees and lianas from the primary forest at the km 67 Tower Site, Tapajos National Forest, and measurements of five sapling tree species and the grass Brachiaria brizantha from a pasture site located near the km 77 Pasture Tower Site, approximately 10 km from the primary forest site. The research area is situated within the Tapajos National Forest reserve, south of the city of Santarem, Para, Brazil. Measurements were made quarterly between March 2000 and March 2001. There is one comma-delimited data file with this data set.",
