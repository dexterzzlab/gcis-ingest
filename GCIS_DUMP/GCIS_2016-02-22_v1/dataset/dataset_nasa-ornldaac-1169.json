    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set reports soil moisture expressed as volumetric water content (VWC), daily precipitation, air temperature, relative humidity, and dew point measurements conducted at the Seca Floresta site, km 67, Tapajos National Forest, Brazil. The measurements were part of the Rainfall Exclusion Experiment (REE) established to study the response of a humid Amazonian forest to severe drought. VWC was measured with continuous high-resolution frequency-domain reflectometry to 11-m depth in two 1-ha plots from 1999 to 2007. One plot was subjected to ~75 percent throughfall exclusion during the rainy season (exclusion) and another monitored under normal conditions (control). Daily precipitation was measured in the control plot and in a nearby clearing between 1999 and 2006 using wedge rain gauges. Air temperature, relative humidity, and dew point were measured along the vertical forest profile of the control and dry plots of the site between 2000 and 2003. There are three comma-delimited data files (.csv) with this data set.",
