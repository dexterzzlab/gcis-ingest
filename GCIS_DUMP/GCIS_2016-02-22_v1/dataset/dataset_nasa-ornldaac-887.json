    "description": "ABSTRACT: The ASTER high resolution satellite data are available for visible-near infrared (15m resolution), short wave infrared (30m), and thermal infrared (90m) bands. Two sets of imagery were collected over Roraima state - Brazil covering a strip of approximately 180 X 60 km each on January 19 and 28, 2003. Each date has one prescribed burn and many other opportunistic fires. Data format is ASTER L1B HDF. There is a corresponding *.met file (metadata file) for each hdf file. These files can be opened using any standard hdf viewer, ENVI can recognize the bands and georegistration automatically. The companion document, ASTER_GeoRef_FINAL.pdf, gives a good description of how to georeference ASTER L1B data and to open the files in ERDAS Imagine and also older ENVI versions.",
