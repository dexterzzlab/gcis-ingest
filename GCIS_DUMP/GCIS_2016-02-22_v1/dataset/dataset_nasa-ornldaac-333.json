    "description": "ABSTRACT: The BOREAS TE-07 team collected data sets in support of its efforts to characterize and interpret information on the sapflow and dendrology of boreal vegetation. This data set contains dendrology measurements, consisting of tree ring width and density taken at several points within each ring. Measurements were taken near the TE towers at the OJP and OBS sites in NSA. In the SSA, measurements were taken near the TE towers at the MIX, OBS, and OJP sites; at the AIM-13 and BMH-9 sites; and near the TF-YJP site. All data were collected during the summer of 1994. Note that the TE-07 dendrology data available for the ORNL DAAC are a summary and an inventoru of the full Canadian Forest Service (CFS) data set. Please see Section 1.5 of the complete data set reference document for information on obtaining the CFS data set.",
