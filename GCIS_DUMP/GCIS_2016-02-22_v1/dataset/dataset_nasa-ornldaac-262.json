    "description": "ABSTRACT: The BOREAS HYD-03 team collected several data sets related to the hydrology of forested areas. This data set contains measurements of snow depth, snow density in 3-cm intervals, an integrated snow pack density and snow water equivalent (SWE), and snow pack physical properties from snow pit evaluation taken in 1994 and 1996. The data were collected from several sites in both the SSA and the NSA. A variety of standard tools were used to measure the snowpack properties, including a meter stick (snow depth), a 100 cc snow density cutter, a dial stem thermometer and the Canadian snow sampler as used by HYD-04 to obtain a snow pack-integrated measure of SWE. This study was undertaken to predict spatial distributions of snow properties important to the hydrology, remote sensing signatures, and the transmissivity of gases through the snow.",
