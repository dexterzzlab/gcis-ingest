    "description": "The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) instrument on the NASA EOS Aqua satellite provides global passive microwave measurements of terrestrial, oceanic, and atmospheric variables for the investigation of water and energy cycles. This Level-3 rainfall accumulation product (AE_RnGd) consists of two grids of 28 rows by 72 columns of monthly averaged rainfall accumulation over ocean and land. Both grids are 5 degree by 5 degree resolution. Monthly ocean rainfall accumulation (mm) is derived from the Wilheit, Kummerow, and Ferraro (1991) algorithm, using Level-2A brightness temperatures as input. Monthly land rainfall accumulation (mm) is derived from the McCollum and Ferraro (2003) algorithm, using Level-2B rainfall data as input. Data are stored in HDF-EOS format, and are available from 19 June 2002 to 1 October 2011 via FTP.",
