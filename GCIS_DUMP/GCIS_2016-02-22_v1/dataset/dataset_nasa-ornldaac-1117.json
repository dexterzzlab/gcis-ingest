    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set reports soil carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) concentrations and soil volumetric water content (VWC) from a rainfall exclusion experiment that was conducted at the km 67 Seca Floresta site, Tapajos National Forest, Brazil. Samples were collected every two to three months. The purpose was to observe the potential effects of severe water stress on a humid Amazonian forest (Nepstad 2002). Data provided are from December 9, 1999, and April 2, 2000-June 14, 2002. There is one comma-delimited data file with this data set.",
