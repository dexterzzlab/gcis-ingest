    "description": "The <em>SMEX03 Site Photographs</em> data set includes photographs of the regional study areas of Alabama, Georgia, and Oklahoma, USA as part of the 2003 Soil Moisture Experiment (SMEX03). The photographs were taken in the field at various locations during the SMEX03 campaign from June 2003 to July 2003. This collection of images is intended to be a visual aid to investigators of the SMEX03 data sets, as they display the conditions to present during the SMEX03 USA campaign. The total volume for this data set is approximately 320 megabytes. The photographs are provided in JPEG image files and are available via FTP. These data were collected as part of a validation study for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). AMSR-E is a mission instrument launched aboard NASA's Aqua Satellite on 04 May 2002. AMSR-E validation studies linked to SMEX are designed to evaluate the accuracy of AMSR-E soil moisture data. Specific validation objectives include assessing and refining soil moisture algorithm performance; verifying soil moisture estimation accuracy; investigating the effects of vegetation, surface temperature, topography, and soil texture on soil moisture accuracy; and determining the regions that are useful for AMSR-E soil moisture measurements.",
