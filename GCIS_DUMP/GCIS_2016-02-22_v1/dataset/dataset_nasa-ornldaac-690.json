    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set is a 1-kilometer resolution land cover map for the land area of the Primor'ye and Southern Khabarovsk Regions, in the Russian Far East, based on 1990 NOAA AVHRR data. Labeling of land cover classes depended upon the Russian 1990 Forest Cover Map (Garsia, 1990), the analyst's experience with AVHRR data, and Russian data sources. There are eight classes distinguished in this dataset, of which 5 are forest cover classes.The objective of this work was to create a 1-km resolution land cover map of the region of the Far Eastern Siberia based on NOAA AVHRR data which might be used by World Wildlife Fund researchers to aid in the definition of remaining habitats and range for threatened animal species (Stone and Schlesinger, 1996).",
