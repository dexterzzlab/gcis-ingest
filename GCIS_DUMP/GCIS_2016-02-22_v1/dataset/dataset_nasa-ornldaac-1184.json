    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set provides classified land cover transition images (maps) derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Multispectral Scanner (MSS) imagery for Ariquemes, Luiza, and Ji-Parana&#194;&#161; areas in Rondonia, Brazil, at 30-m resolution. Images depict the age relative to the year 2000, of cleared land from the date the land was cut, to the date when primary forests transitioned into nonforest class (for example, 25 = cut by 1975, or 25 years before the year 2000). Temporal changes in three regions are represented by 31 TM scenes acquired between 1984 and 1999, and a pair of MSS scenes from 1975 and 1978. Data are provided as three GeoTiff (*.tif) images, one for each of the three areas.",
