    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set is a 1:15 million scale forest cover map for the land area of the Former Soviet Union. Twenty-two land cover classes are distinguished, of which 20 are forest cover classes. The source data were acquired by map digitization from the Atlas of Forests of the USSR (Anon. 1973) which was likely based on forestry data from the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s.",
