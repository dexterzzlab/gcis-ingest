    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set provides estimates of aboveground biomass (AGB) for defined land cover types within World Wildlife Fund (WWF) ecoregions across the boreal biome of eastern and western Eurasia, roughly between 50 and 70 degrees N. The study focused on within-growing-season data, i.e. leaf-on conditions. The AGB estimates were derived from a series of models that first related ground-based measured biomass to airborne data collected with an Optech Airborne Laser Terrain Mapper (ALTM) 3100, and a second set of models that related the airborne estimates of biomass to Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) LiDAR canopy structure measurements. The ground, airborne, and GLAS measurements were used to formulate the models needed to generate biomass predictions for western Eurasia. Eastern Eurasia employed a two-phase approach relating field measurements directly to the GLAS measurements without the airborne intermediary. The GLAS LiDAR biomass estimates were extrapolated by land cover types and ecoregions across the entire biome area. The study compiled remotely sensed forest structure data collected in June of 2005 and 2006 from the GLAS LiDAR instrument aboard the NASA Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation (ICESat) satellite and from an Optech Airborne Laser Terrain Mapper (ALTM) 3100 airborne instrument flown in Southeast Norway over both the ground plots and the ICESat GLAS flight path. For a consistent biome-level analysis, ecoregions contained within the boreal forest biome were identified by the World Wildlife Fund's (WWF) ecoregion map of the world (Olson et al., 2001). MODIS MOD12Q1 land cover products (2004) were used to identify land cover types for stratification purposes within eco-regions. The ground-based measurements are not provided with this data set.",
