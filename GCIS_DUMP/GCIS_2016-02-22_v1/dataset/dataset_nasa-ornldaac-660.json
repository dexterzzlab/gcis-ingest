    "description": "ABSTRACT: Rooting depths were estimated from a global database of root profiles that was assembled from the primary literature to study relationships of abiotic and biotic factors associated with belowground vegetation structure. Variables used to characterize belowground vegetation structure include the depths above which 50% of all roots and 95% of all roots are located in the profile. For each root profile, information recorded includes latitude and longitude, elevation, soil texture, depth of organic horizons, type of roots measured (e.g., fine or total, live or dead), sampling methods, units of measurements (root mass, length, number, surface area), and sampling depth.",
