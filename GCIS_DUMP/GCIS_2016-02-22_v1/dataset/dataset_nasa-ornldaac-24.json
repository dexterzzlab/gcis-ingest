    "description": "ABSTRACT: The Bowen Ratio Surface Flux Observations (USGS) Data Set contains surface flux and micrometeorological collected from one location within the Northwest quadrant of the FIFE study area. Data were collected daily at this location only during the IFC's during the period from late May through mid-October, 1987. Each Bowen ratio station was capable of measuring the fluxes of net radiation, sensible heat, and latent heat. The Bowen ratio stations measured the soil heat flux as well.",
