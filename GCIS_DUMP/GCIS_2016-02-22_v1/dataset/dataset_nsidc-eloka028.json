    "description": "The Bering Sea Sub-Network (BSSN) is comprised of a set of coastal communities representing six indigenous cultures: three in the Russian Federation and three in the United States. The objective of BSSN is to develop a framework that will enable residents in remote Arctic communities to systematically document physical and social changes occurring in their region. In 2008 and 2009, approximately 300 hunters and fishermen participated a pilot project of harvest surveys covering species caught, species health, and intended use; changing climate and environmental conditions; location and travel information; and a review of harvest conditions. This data set is a report of the preliminary findings from the pilot phase of BSSN.",
