    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set contains forest cover information for 2001 for all of South America. The data were collected by the MODIS sensor onboard the TERRA platform and released by the MODIS team as an image showing percent canopy cover. This information was then reclassified so that all pixels with a percent canopy cover greater than 40% (40% after the 1973 UNESCO standard) were classified as forest (a value of 1), and all other pixels were classified as non-forest (a value of 2). Water features were given a value of 3. This data has a pixel resolution of 500 meters and is unprojected with the WGS-1984 datum (Hansen et al. 2006). There is one GeoTIFF data file for this data set.",
