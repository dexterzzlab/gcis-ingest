    "description": "ABSTRACT: The FIFE Standing Crop and Nitrogen Content Data Set contains biomass and nitrogen concentration data for live and dead above-ground plant material collected along transects in watersheds within the FIFE study area. The transects were in watersheds that had undergone burning and grazing treatments. Point physical descriptors (elevation, slope, and soil depth) are also included in the data set. Substantial variation in biomass, and N accumulation occurred over time, with topography, and as a result of grazing and previous burning (Schimel et al. 1991a, Kittel et al. 1990, Turner et al. 1992, Davis et al. 1992).",
