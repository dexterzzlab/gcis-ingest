    "description": "ABSTRACT: The BOREAS HYD-03 team collected several data sets related to the hydrology of forested areas. This data set contains measurements of canopy density (closure) from a variety of sites. Canopy density measurements were made during the FFC-W and FFC-T 1994 in both the SSA and NSA using a forest densiometer. This study was undertaken to predict spatial distributions of energy transfer, snow properties important to the hydrology, remote sensing signatures, and transmissivity of gases through the snow and their relation to forests in boreal ecosystems.",
