    "description": "ABSTRACT: The Fifteen Minute Stream Flow Data from the USGS Data Set contains 15 minute stream flow data from the USGS station located 2.9 miles upstream from the mouth of Kings Creek. The record extends from April 1, 1979 through September 2, 1988. The purpose of this data set was to provide accurate measurements of the stream flow from Kings Creek so that a water budget analysis for the northwest quadrant of the FIFE study area could be performed. The stilling pipe installed at the USGS station operates on the principle that the water level in a standpipe at a specific location within a stream bed can be converted to a volume of water in the stream bed. The tracking of the change in stream height with time then enables the calculation of stream flow.",
