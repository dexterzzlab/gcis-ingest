    "description": "ABSTRACT: Above-ground litter productivity was measured in a 18 ha plot adjacent to the eddy flux tower at the logged forest tower site, km 83, Tapajos National Forest, Para, Brazil. Thirty litter baskets distributed within the grid were visited bi-weekly (Goulden et al., 2004). Oven dry mass of leaves, wood, reproductive parts and miscellaneous components of the collected litter was determined for each collection. Collections covered a pre-harvest period (Sept 2000 - July 2001) and a post- harvest period (Aug 2001-Mar 2003). There is one comma-delimited data file with this data set.",
