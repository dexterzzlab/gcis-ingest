    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set reports the oxygen isotope signatures of water extracted from plant tissue (xylem from the stems and leaf tissue) and of atmospheric water vapor from twelve different sites (including both pasture and forest) throughout the Amazon region of Brazil. Samples were collected approximately every 4 months between 1999 and 2003 with additional samples collected monthly between January and May of 2003. In 2004 the collection of water samples from plant tissue continued at two sites, though water vapor collections were discontinued, and measurements of deuterium signatures were added to the analyses. In addition, water vapor from the troposphere was collected during a series of aircraft flights over the Tapajos National Forest in May of 2003 and analyzed for oxygen isotopes using the same methodology. There is one comma-delimited ASCII data file with this data set.",
