    "description": "ABSTRACT: For BOREAS, the MAS images, along with the other remotely sensed data, were collected to provide spatially-extensive information over the primary study areas. This information includes detailed land cover and biophysical parameter maps such as fPAR (fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation), and LAI (Leaf Area Index). Collection of the MAS images occurred over the study areas during the 1994 field campaigns. The level-1B MAS data cover the dates of 21-Jul-1994, 24-Jul-1994, 04-Aug-1994 and 08-Aug-1994. The data are not geographically/geometrically corrected; however, files of relative X and Y coordinates for each image pixel were derived by using the C130 INS data in a MAS scan model.",
