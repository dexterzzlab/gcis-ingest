    "description": "ABSTRACT: The objective of this work was to produce a monthly climatology of broadband surface albedos for use in global numerical weather prediction models at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). Monthly means of clear-sky, surface, broadband, snow-free albedos for overhead sun illumination angle were determined using data from a five-year period from April 1985-December 1987 and January 1989-March 1991. The data set is compatible in temporal coverage and spatial resolution with a monthly climatology of green vegetation fraction (Gutman and Ignatov, 1998) delivered earlier and currently in use at NCEP. Files showing the differences between the original data set and the Land/water mask used in the International Satellite land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Initiative II are also provided.",
