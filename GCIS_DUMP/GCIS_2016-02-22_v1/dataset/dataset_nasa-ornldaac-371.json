    "description": "ABSTRACT: The BOREAS TF-11 team collected several data sets in their efforts to fully describe the flux and site characteristics at the SSA-Fen site. This data set contains fluxes of methane and carbon dioxide at the SSA fen site measured using static chambers. The measurements were conducted as part of a 2x2 factorial experiment in which we added carbon (300 g m-2 as wheat straw) and nitrogen (6 g m-2 as urea) to four replicate locations in the vicinity of the TF-11 tower. In addition to siting and treatment variables, it reports air temperature and water table height relative to the average peat surface during each measurement. The data set covers the period from the first week of June 1994 through the second week of September, 1994.",
