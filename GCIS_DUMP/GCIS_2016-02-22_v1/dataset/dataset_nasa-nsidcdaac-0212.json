    "description": "This data set includes 94 GHz co- and cross-polarized radar reflectivity. The Airborne Cloud Radar (ACR) sensor was mounted to a NASA P-3 aircraft flown over the Sea of Japan, the Western Pacific Ocean, and the Japanese Islands. The ACR data were acquired during the AMSR/AMSR-E Wakasa Bay Field Campaign in January and February 2003. Data are available in network Common Data Format (netCDF) from NSIDC via FTP. The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) is a mission instrument launched aboard NASA's Aqua Satellite on 4 May 2002. The Wakasa Bay field campaign was designed to validate both AMSR and AMSR-E shallow rainfall and snowfall retrieval capabilities.",
