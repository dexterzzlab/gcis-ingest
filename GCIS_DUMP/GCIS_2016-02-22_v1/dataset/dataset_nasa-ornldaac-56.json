    "description": "ABSTRACT: Light radiation striking a vegetative canopy interacts with individual phyto-elements (i.e., leaves, stems, branches) and the underlying substrate. The interaction depends on light quality, radiative form (direct or diffuse), illumination incidence angle, vegetative component optical properties and canopy architecture. Radiation is reflected, transmitted or absorbed. Mowing, grazing, and fertilization can affect the canopy architecture or optical properties of vegetation, thus changing the canopy reflectance. This study examined the response of spectral reflectance characteristics (using an Exotech radiometer) to canopies that were manipulated using simulated grazing and fertilization of plots. The spectral reflectance data set supports the original hypothesis of a curvilinear relationship between productivity and grazing intensity. Reflectances for the four MSS bands and the standard error for each are reported. These data were collected at two locations within the northwest quadrant of the FIFE study area during the growing season of 1987. Reflected radiation measurements were converted to radiances and reflectance factor. The reflectance factor is the ratio of the target reflected radiant flux to an ideal radiant flux reflected by an ideal Lambertian standard surface irradiated in exactly the same way as the target.",
