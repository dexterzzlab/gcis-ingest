    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set contains measurements from the NOAA/ATDD Long-EZ Aircraft collected during the 1994 IFCs at the SSA. These measurements were made from various instruments mounted on the aircraft. The data that were collected include: aircraft altitude, wind direction, wind speed, air temperature, potential temperature, water mixing ratio, U and V components of wind velocity, static pressure, surface radiative temperature, downwelling and upwelling total radiation, downwelling and upwelling longwave radiation, net radiation, downwelling and upwelling PAR, greenness index, CO2 concentration, O3 concentration, and CH4 concentration. There are also various columns that indicate the standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, and trend of some of these data.",
