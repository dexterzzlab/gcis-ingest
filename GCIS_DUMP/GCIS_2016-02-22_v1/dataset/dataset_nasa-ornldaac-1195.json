    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set provides derived emission factors (EFs), reported in grams of compound emitted per kilogram of dry fuel (g/kg), for PM10 (particulate matter up to 10 micrometers in size), O3, CO2, CO, NO, NO2, HONO, HCN, NH3, OCS, DMS, CH4, and up to 48 non-methane organic compounds (NMOC) from the Tropical Forest and Fire Emissions Experiment (TROFFEE). TROFFEE used laboratory measurements followed by airborne and ground based field campaigns in Mato Grosso, Para, and Amazonas, Brazil during the 2004 Amazon dry season to quantify the emissions from pristine tropical forest and several plantations as well as the emissions, fuel consumption, and fire ecology of tropical deforestation fires. EFs were determined for 19 tropical deforestation fires in August and September, 2004. The combined output of these fires created a massive megaplume more than 500-km wide and covered a large area in Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay for about one month. For the megaplume, the EFs (reported in grams of compound emitted per kilogram of dry fuel (g/kg)) represented the effective emissions factor measured downwind from the source. There are two comma-delimited data files (.csv) and one text file (.txt) with this data set. The text file contains information regarding the fuel/fire sources, latitude and longitudes (also provided in the data files).",
