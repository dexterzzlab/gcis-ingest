    "description": "ABSTRACT: Ozonesonde launches were made by the Southern Hemisphere ADditional OZonesondes (SHADOZ) group as part of the SAFARI 2000 Dry Season Campaign in September 2000 (Thompson et al., 2002). Ozonesondes are balloon-borne instruments measuring profile ozone, as well as temperature and pressure from an attached radiosonde, up to 35 km in height (around 5 hPa in pressure coordinates) capturing the troposphere and lower stratospheric portion of the atmosphere. During the campaign, ozonesondes were launched daily during the height of the burning season and in a region of active biomass burning activity.",
