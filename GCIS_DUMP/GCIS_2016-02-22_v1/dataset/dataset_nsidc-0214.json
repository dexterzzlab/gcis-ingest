    "description": "At the Siple Dome area of Antarctica, much of the ice flow is vertical, which causes vertical ice deformation. To measure this phenomenon, the investigators used a method known as vertical strain rate. This project was a part of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Cores (WAISCORES) project for deep ice coring in West Antarctica. WAISCORES is supported by the Office of Polar Programs (OPP), National Science Foundation (NSF). This data set consists of a table of long-term average strain rates measured between 1999 and 2002 at Siple Dome, Antarctica. The measurements were taken in hot-water boreholes by bridge gauges. Data are available in tab-delimited ASCII text format or PDF via FTP.",
