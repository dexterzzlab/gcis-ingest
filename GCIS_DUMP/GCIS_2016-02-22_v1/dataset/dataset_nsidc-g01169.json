    "description": "This data set contains observations of albedo, depth, and physical characteristics of melt ponds on sea ice, taken during the summer of 1994. The melt ponds studied were located just south of Cornwallis Island in the Barrow Strait, Nunavat, Canada. The reflectance spectra were acquired with a portable spectrometer. Cloud conditions and ice type were recorded as well.",
