    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set contains five data files in text format (.txt). Three files contain biomass dynamics data for a broad-leaved savanna located in the 800-hectare Nylsvley study site 200 km north of Johannesburg, South Africa. One net primary productivity (NPP) file contains monthly above-ground biomass data from harvests made between mid-October 1974 and mid-September 1977. A second NPP file contains three-year mean monthly values for above-ground, standing dead, and litter biomass. The third NPP file contains monthly below-ground living and dead biomass data from excavations made from August 1988 to November 1989. Climate data are provided in the other two files. One file contains air temperature data measured at the study site (1975-1983). The other file contains rainfall data measured at a nearby farmhouse (1917-1995). Revision Notes: Only the documentation for this data set has been modified. The data files have been checked for accuracy and are identical to those originally published.",
