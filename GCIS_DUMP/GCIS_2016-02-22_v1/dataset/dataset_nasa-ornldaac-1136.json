    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set provides measurements of carbon dioxide flux rates (FCO2), gas transfer velocity (k), and partial pressures (pCO2) at 75 sites on rivers and streams of the Amazon River system in South America for the period beginning July 1, 2004, and ending January 23, 2007. Several fieldwork campaigns occurred between June 2004 and January 2007 in the Amazon River basin, with discharge conditions ranging from low to high flow. The sampled areas span the spectrum of chemical characteristics observed across the entire basin, including, for example, both low and high pH values and suspended sediment loads. There is one comma-delimited data file in this data set.",
