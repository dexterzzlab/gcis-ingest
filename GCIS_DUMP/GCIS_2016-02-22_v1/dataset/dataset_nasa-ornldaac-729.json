    "description": "ABSTRACT: The University of Wyoming has a series of balloonborne radiosonde measurements from all around the world, from the surface to 30 km. This data set contains upper air meteorological profiles from 594 radiosonde launches deployed from sites in South Africa. These sonde launches were made to augment the regional sounding network in the region during the SAFARI 2000 Dry Season Campaign of 2000.Vaisala RS80 sondes were launched from nine sites in South Africa between August 1, 2000 and September 30, 2000. The launch sites were Pietersburg (changed to Polokwane after 2000), Pretoria (Irene), Bethlehem, Springbok, De Aar, Durban, Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, and Gough Island. The parameters measured by the radiosonde instruments include: pressure, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and wind direction.",
