    "description": "ABSTRACT: Chamber flux measurements were taken at the Boreal Ecosystem Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) Northern Study Area (NSA) Old Jack Pine (OJP) and Young Jack Pine (YJP) sites during the summer of 1994. The purpose of these measurements was to examine the trace gas exchange between the atmosphere and the boreal soils. The following is a description of the acquisition of data and the final datasets. The BOREAS TGB-01 team made sulfur hexaflouride (SF6) dark chamber flux measurements 16-May through 13-Sep-1994. Gas samples were extracted approximately every 7 days from dark chambers and analyzed at the NSA lab facility.",
