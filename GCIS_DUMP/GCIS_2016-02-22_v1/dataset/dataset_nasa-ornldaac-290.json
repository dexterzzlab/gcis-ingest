    "description": "ABSTRACT: The RSS-03 team acquired helicopter-based measurements of forested sites during BOREAS with a Barnes MMR. The data were collected in 1994 during the rhree BOREAS IFCs at numerous tower and auxiliary sites in both the NSA and SSA. The 15-degree FOV of the MMR yielded approximately 79 m from the 300 m altitude ground resolution. The MMR has seven spectral bands that are similar to the Landsat TM bands, ranging from the blue region to the thermal. Note:",
