    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set describes the nitrogen and chlorophyll content of small, monospecific canopies formed from seedlings of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum). The trees were provided different levels of fertilization in order to produce canopies with varying nitrogen and chlorophyll concentration. For the Douglas-fir, fertilization was provided during the dormant season, so there were no differences in growth or leaf area among canopies, and canopies were at a constant density with varying foliar chemistry. For the maple, seedlings were aggregated at various densities, producing a matrix of leaf area as well as chemistry variations. Before destructive analysis for foliar chemistry, canopy reflectance was measured under natural sunlight (see ACCP Seedling Canopy Reflectance Spectra Data).",
