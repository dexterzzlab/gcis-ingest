    "description": "This data set is part of the WAISCORES project, an NSF-funded project to understand the influence of the West Antarctic ice sheet on climate and sea level change. WAISCORES researchers acquired and analyzed ice cores from the Siple Dome, in the Siple Coast region, West Antarctica. Taylor measured the electrical conductivity (ECM) and Complex Conductivity (CC), a measure of the total ions in the ice, in the main Siple Dome ice core. Measurements were taken along the core from a depth of 0 m to 800 m. The project also analyzed shallower cores for ECM and dielectric properties (DEP). (DEP is also a measure of the total ions in the ice, but with lower spatial resolution than the CC.) Albedo measurements where made on the shallow cores and the main core to a depth of 391 m. The data set includes images showing the electrical conductivity of a vertical section of the core.",
