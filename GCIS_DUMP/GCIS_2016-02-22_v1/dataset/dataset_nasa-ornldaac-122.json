    "description": "ABSTRACT: The NOAA Regional Surface Data - 1989 (NCDC) Data Set contains hourly surface meteorological data for the FIFE area. Though the measurements presented in this data set were not taken precisely at the FIFE study area, it is hypothesized that they present a representative horizontal cross-section of meteorological variables and sky conditions in and around the site. It is also realized that many of the variables presented in this data set are somewhat subjective and dependent on the skill (and biases) of the observer, such as estimates of cloud amount and height. This data may be used as input data and/or verification data for numerical simulation models.",
