    "description": "Degree day is a quantitative index that reflects the demand for energy to either heat or cool houses and businesses. Divisional degree day values are computed from climate division monthly temperatures using a statistical algorithm. The climate division values are then weighted by population, using 2010 Census data, to derive a national, population-weighted average. Population weighting assures that degree-day averages reflect conditions in more densely populated areas of the country. The heating and cooling degree day computations are based on mean daily temperature (average of the daily maximum and minimum temperatures) of 65\u00b0F. Heating degree days are summations of negative differences between the mean daily temperature and the 65\u00b0F base; cooling degree days are summations of positive differences from the 65\u00b0F base.
