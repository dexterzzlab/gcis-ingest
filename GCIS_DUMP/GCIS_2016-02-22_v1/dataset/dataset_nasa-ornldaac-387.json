    "description": "ABSTRACT: This vector format data set covers the province of Manitoba and was produced by Forestry Canada from hand-drawn boundaries of fires on photocopies of 1:250,000 scale maps. The locational accuracy of the data is considered fair to poor. When the locations of some fire boundaries were compared to Landsat TM images, they were found to be off by as much as a few kilometers.",
