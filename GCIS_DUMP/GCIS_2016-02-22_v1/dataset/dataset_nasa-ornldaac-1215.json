    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set provides field measurements of diameter, tree height, and crown dimensions for 1,513 trees in 30 plots at the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. Fourteen of these plots were in undisturbed primary forest, six were in primary forest which had been selectively logged, seven were secondary forests, and three were abandoned pastures reverting to forest. The diameter and height data were used to calculate aboveground biomass for each of the 30 plots. The crown measurements were used to estimate a vertical profile for each plot, showing the vegetation volume in 1 meter increments from the ground to the top of the canopy. There are three comma-delimited data files and two shapefiles with this data set. The files contain the measurements and calculated biomass for the individual stems as well as the summary data at the plot level.",
