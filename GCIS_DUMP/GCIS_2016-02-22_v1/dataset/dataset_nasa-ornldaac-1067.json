    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set includes measurements of dissolved nutrient and organic carbon concentrations, as well as dissolved oxygen, alkalinity, conductivity, turbidity, pH, and discharge from three streams located in mixed land use (crop fields, pastures, secondary vegetation, and forest) and two streams in entirely forested landscapes near Paragominas in the state of Para, Brazil. Stream water samples were collected during two different periods: 1) weekly from August 1999 to July 2001 at location Igarape 54, Station 5 and 2) monthly from April 2003 through October 2005 at all of the stations. The exact start date and suite of measurements vary by location. In addition, samples from precipitation collectors at the Paragominas Meteorological Station were measured for nutrient concentrations every two weeks from 1999 to 2001. There are two comma delimited ASCII data files with this data set.",
