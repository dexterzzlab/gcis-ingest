    "description": "ABSTRACT: Measurements of light, CO2, temperature, and humidity response curves were made by the BOREAS TE-04 team during the summary of 1994 using intact attached leaves of boreal forest species located in the BOREAS SSA. These measurements were conducted to calibrate models used to predict photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and leaf respiration. The data can be used to construct plots of response functions or for parameterizing models. Parameter values suitable for application in SiB2 (Sellers et al., 1996) or the leaf model of Collatz et al. (1991) and programs can be obtained from the investigators.",
