    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set reports the results of the analysis of soil samples for Nitrate (NO3) and physical properties that were collected for one year following reduced impact logging in logging concessions at the Fazenda Rohsamar in the municipality of Juruena in northwestern Mato Grosso. Sample locations were randomly selected from stratified regions of the 1,400 ha Block 5 to account for local scale soil variability. Soil samples were collected to 8-m depth in (1) nine gaps formed by single tree removal and (2) nine areas of undisturbed primary forest. Areas of undisturbed forest were confined to patches of forest within Block 5 that were protected from logging. An additional 3 forested areas were sampled to 3-m depth that contained high sand content. These results quantified the effects of reduced impact logging, to test whether nitrogen (N) loss from leaves and coarse woody debris under reduced impact logging results in a significant accumulation of subsoil nitrate (Feldpausch et al., 2009). One comma separated data file contains the soil moisture results and a second file the soil NO3 content and soil physical properties.",
