    "description": "Parameters for this data set include precipitation, soil temperature, volumetric soil moisture, soil conductivity, and soil salinity measured in the Little River Watershed (LRW) Micronet regional study areas of southeastern Georgia, USA. Data for this study were collected from 01 May 2003 through 31 August 2003 using in situ soil moisture sensors at depths of 2, 8, and 12 inches in addition to tipping bucket rain gauges as part of the Soil Moisture Experiment 2003 (SMEX03). These data are provided in ASCII comma-delimited text format and are available via FTP. These data were collected as part of a validation study for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). AMSR-E is a mission instrument launched aboard NASA's Aqua Satellite on 04 May 2002. AMSR-E validation studies linked to SMEX are designed to evaluate the accuracy of AMSR-E soil moisture data. Specific validation objectives include assessing and refining soil moisture algorithm performance; verifying soil moisture estimation accuracy; investigating the effects of vegetation, surface temperature, topography, and soil texture on soil moisture accuracy; and determining the regions that are useful for AMSR-E soil moisture measurements.",
