    "description": "ABSTRACT: The BOREAS TE-12 team collected several data sets in support of its efforts to characterize and interpret information on the reflectance, transmittance, and gas exchange of boreal vegetation. This data set contains measurements of hemispherical spectral reflectance and transmittance factors of individual leaves, needles (ages: current and past 2 years' growth, i.e., for 1993, the growing seasons of 1993, 1992, and 1991 were measured; in 1994, the growing seasons of 1994, 1993, and 1992 were measured), twigs (reflectance only), and substrate at near-normal incidence measured using a LI-COR LI-1800-12 integrating sphere attached to a Spectron Engineering SE590 spectroradiometer. Procedures of Daughtry et al. (1989) were followed. These procedures permitted measurement of samples that: 1) filled the entire integrating sphere sample port, and 2) were narrow with a length greater than the sample port diameter. Optical properties were measured at the SSA Fen,YJP, YA, and OBS sites.",
