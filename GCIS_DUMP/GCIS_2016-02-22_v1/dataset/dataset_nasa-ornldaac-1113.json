    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set provides the results of (1) the physical and chemical characterization of streams and (2) comparable chemical analyses of extracted soil water in the Aldeia River basin at Fazenda Nova Vida, a large cattle ranch 50 km from the city of Ariquemes, in central Rondonia, Brazil, from 1994-2001. Data are provided on the stream beds including cross-sectional depth and stream bed surface type. Stream discharge is reported. Streamwater was sampled and analyzed periodically over the eight year duration of the study at numerous steam locations. Soil solution samples were collected at the same frequency with lysimeters placed at 30 cm and 100 cm depths on the floodplain and at upland forest and pasture sites in the Aldeia River watershed. There are five comma-delimited data files in this data set.",
