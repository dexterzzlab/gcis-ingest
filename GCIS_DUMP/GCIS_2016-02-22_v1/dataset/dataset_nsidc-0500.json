    "description": "This data set consists of inferred accumulation rates from three radar layers (26, 35 and 41 thousand years old) in the Vostok Subglacial Lake region. Accumulation rates were inferred using Local-Layer Approximation (LLA), which assumes that the strain-rate history of a particle traveling through the ice sheet can be approximated by the vertical strain-rate profile at the current position of the particle, which the researchers assume to be uniform. Parameters include location, in latitude and longitude, polar stereographic coordinates, and local grid X and Y coordinates, along with layer age, in thousands of years (ka), and inferred accumulation rate (cm/a). The data cover a 150 by 350 km area. Data are available via FTP, as a text file (.txt) with columns in comma separated value format.",
