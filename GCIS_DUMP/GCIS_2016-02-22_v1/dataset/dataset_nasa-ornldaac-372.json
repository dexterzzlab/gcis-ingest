    "description": "ABSTRACT: The BOREAS TF-11 team collected several data sets in their efforts to fully describe the flux and site characteristics at the SSA-Fen site. This data set contains decomposition rates of a standard substrate (wheat straw) across treatments. The measurements were conducted as part of a 2x2 factorial experiment in which we added carbon (300 g m-2 as wheat straw) and nitrogen (6 g m-2 as urea) to four replicate locations in the vicinity of the TF-11 tower.",
