    "description": "ABSTRACT: During the 1989 FIFE field campaign, measurements were made of soil moisture release parameters and hydraulic conductivity. Bulk density and soil moisture release data were collected at five FIFE sites representing the major soil types in the FIFE study area. These data were used to model the porosity, saturated water potential, and the b-factor (the exponent of the power curve function) following the method of Clapp and Hormberger (1978). These soil moisture characteristics can be used to describe plant-available water and water movement through soils.",
