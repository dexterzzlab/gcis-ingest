    "description": "ABSTRACT: Phase II and III gridded data sets have been generated by an objective analysis scheme using all of the surface meteorological station data over BOREAS region for 1994-1996. Additionally, FSU GOES incoming solar radiation retrievals and BOREAS rain radar retrievals during portions of 1994 and 1996 were used when remote sensing products were available. Two Phase II, Northern Study Area (NSA) and Southern Study Area (SSA) grids, and one Phase III, Regional, gridded data sets have been assembled on a HOURLY time step. The meteorological variables in this data set are surface air pressure, air temperature, dew point temperature, wind speed, wind direction, precipitation, incoming solar (shortwave) radiation, and incoming infrared (longwave) radiation.",
