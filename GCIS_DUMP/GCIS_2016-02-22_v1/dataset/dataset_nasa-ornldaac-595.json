    "description": "ABSTRACT: BOREAS follow-on group DSP-9 mapped surface moss type at three scales (1 km, 30 m, and 10 m) based on observed associations between moss cover and land cover type. In the BOREAS Northern (NSA) and Southern (SSA) Study Areas, we utilized land cover derived from Landsat TM (30 m) and ground measurements/observations, soils maps, and field observations to establish associations between moss and land cover. At the BOREAS regional scale, the 1 km moss cover map was developed using a 1 km AVHRR land cover map for a 619 by 821 km subset of the BOREAS region. Our regional moss cover map is largely based on inferences from the 1 km land cover analysis and from ground observations in the study areas. The 30 m moss map covers the BOREAS Southern Study Area. The 10 m map covers the BOREAS NSA Old Black Spruce tower site.",
