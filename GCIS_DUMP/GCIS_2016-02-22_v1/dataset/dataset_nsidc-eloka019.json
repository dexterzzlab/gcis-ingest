    "description": "The Kangiqtugaapik (Clyde River), Nunavut, Canada, Weather Station Network is a collection of weather station data from the locations of Akuliaqattak, Silasiutitalik, and Ailaktalik in the Clyde River area. Data collection for the Silalirijiit project began in June 2010 and is ongoing. An online interface shows the current conditions at these locations. Weather data from the Kangiqtugaapik Airport Station, collected by Environment Canada, are also provided. The data will be archived at NSIDC in the future; at this time, the site displays current conditions. This data set is part of the Silalirijiit Project and is funded by a National Science Foundation grant (ARC-0753854) entitled IPY: Collaborative Research: Linking Inuit Knowledge and Local-Scale Environmental Modeling to Evaluate the Impacts of Changing Weather on Human Activities at Clyde River, Nunavut.",
