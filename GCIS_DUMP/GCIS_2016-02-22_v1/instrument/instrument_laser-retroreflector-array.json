    "description": "This passive sensor of JPL is used by a ground laser network (of 10-15 SLR stations) to track the position of the satellite for precision orbit determination (verification of altitude measurements). The mass of LRA is 29 kg; the LRA accuracy depends on laser station characteristics. The LRA is used to calibrate the other location systems on the satellite (DORIS, GPSDR) with a very high degree of precision.\n",
