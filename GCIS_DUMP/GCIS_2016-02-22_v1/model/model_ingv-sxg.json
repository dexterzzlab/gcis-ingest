    "description": "INGV-SXG is an Atmosphere Ocean sea-ice General Circulation Model (AOGCM) developed at INGV with the aim of  investigating the features and the mechanisms of the climate variability and change.  This model was used to  produce the INGV-CMCC Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenario simulations. INGV-SXG is an evolution of SINTEX and SINTEX-F and this report indicates the improvement with respect to these previous INGV AOCM model: the new model includes a thermodynamic-dynamic sea-ice model and the capabilities to use external radiative forcings (Ozone, Sulfate Aerosols, Greenhouse Gases) as specified in the protocol for the IPCC standard experiments.\n",
