    "description": "HadCM2 was the first Met Office Hadley Centre coupled model developed under the Unified Modelling system.  HadCM2 stands for the Hadley Centre Coupled Model version 2. It was developed in 1995 and used in the Second Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  The atmospheric component has 19 levels with a horizontal resolution of 2.5 degrees of latitude by 3.75 degrees of longitude, which produces a global grid of 96 x 73 grid cells. This is equivalent to a surface resolution of about 417 km x 278 km at the Equator, reducing to 295 km x 278 km at 45 degrees of latitude.  The oceanic component has 20 levels with a horizontal resolution of 2.5 degrees of latitude by 3.75 degrees of longitude, exactly congruent to the atmosphere.",
