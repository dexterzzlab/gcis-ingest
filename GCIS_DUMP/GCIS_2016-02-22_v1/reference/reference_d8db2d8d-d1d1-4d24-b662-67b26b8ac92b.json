        "Abstract": "\"The author views his topics and objectives from perspectives that have often been neglected. He attempts to provide elements for the incorporation of oxygen into a level- or domain-specific theory, capable of predicting the risk-minimizing behavior of fishes, both under food and oxygen constrains. His primary concerns focus on advancing a theory of growth.\"--Publisher's description.",
