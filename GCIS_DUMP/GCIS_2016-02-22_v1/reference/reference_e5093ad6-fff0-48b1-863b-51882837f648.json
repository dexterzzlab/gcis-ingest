        "Abstract": "We use the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model combined with the GISS general; circulation model to calculate the aerosol direct and indirect (warm cloud) radiative forcings; from US anthropogenic sources over the 1950\u20132050 period, based on historical; 5 emission inventories and future projections from the IPCC A1B scenario. The aerosol; simulation is evaluated with observed spatial distributions and 1980\u20132010 trends of; aerosol concentrations and wet deposition in the contiguous US. The radiative forcing; from US anthropogenic aerosols is strongly localized over the eastern US. We; find that it peaked in 1970\u20131990, with values over the eastern US (east of 100\u000e W); 10 of \u22122.0Wm\u22122 for direct forcing including contributions from sulfate (\u22122.0Wm\u22122), nitrate; (\u22120.2Wm\u22122), organic carbon (\u22120.2Wm\u22122), and black carbon (+0.4Wm\u22122). The; aerosol indirect effect is of comparable magnitude to the direct forcing. We find that; the forcing declined sharply from 1990 to 2010 (by 0.8Wm\u22122 direct and 1.0Wm\u22122 indirect),; mainly reflecting decreases in SO2 emissions, and project that it will continue; 15 declining post-2010 but at a much slower rate since US SO2 emissions have already; declined by almost 60% from their peak. This suggests that much of the warming effect; of reducing US anthropogenic aerosol sources may have already been realized by; 2010, however some additional warming is expected through 2020. The small positive; radiative forcing from US BC emissions (+0.3Wm\u22122 over the eastern US in 2010) sug20; gests that an emission control strategy focused on BC would have only limited climate; benefit.",
