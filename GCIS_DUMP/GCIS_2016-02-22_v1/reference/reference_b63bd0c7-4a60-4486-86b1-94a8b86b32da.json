        "Abstract": "Lake Superior summer (July-September) surface water temperatures have increased approximately 2.5\u00b0C over the interval 1979-2006, equivalent to a rate of (11 \u00b1 6) \u00d7 10^-2\u00b0C yr^-1, significantly in excess of regional atmospheric warming. This discrepancy is caused by declining winter ice cover, which is causing the onset of the positively stratified season to occur earlier at a rate of roughly a half day per year. An earlier start of the stratified season significantly increases the period over which the lake warms during the summer months, leading to a stronger trend in mean summer temperatures than would be expected from changes in summer air temperature alone.",
