This figure illustrates water withdrawals at the U.S. county level: (a) total withdrawals (surface and groundwater) in thousands of gallons per day per square mile; (b) municipal and industrial (including golf course irrigation) withdrawals as percent of total; (c) irrigation, livestock, and aquaculture withdrawals as percent of total; (d) thermoelectric plant cooling withdrawals as percent of total; (e) counties with large surface water withdrawals; and (f) counties with large groundwater withdrawals. The largest withdrawals occur in the drier western states for crop irrigation. In the east, water withdrawals mainly serve municipal, industrial, and thermoelectric uses. Groundwater withdrawals are intense in parts of the Southwest and Northwest, the Great Plains, Mississippi Valley, Florida and South Georgia, and near the Great Lakes (Figure source: Georgia Water Resources Institute, Georgia Institute of Technology; Data from Kenny et al. 2009;<tbib>f532697a-e122-4502-8c18-9504efa60700</tbib> USGS 2013<tbib>f1192640-c0b0-442c-a3c3-8e70b0fcb75b</tbib>).",
