    "methodology": "1. For each model at each grid point, the mean annual temperature under the RCP 6.0 scenario was calculated.\r\n2. For each model, these data were re-gridded to a common grid.\r\n3. For each model at each grid point, the mean annual temperature was calculated under the RCP 6.0 scenario for 2071-2099 and under the historical scenario for 1970-1999 for the same subset of CMIP5 models.\r\n4. At each grid point, the mean temperature for the two periods was computed by averaging the following models:\r\nbcc-csm1-1, CCSM4, CESM1-CAM5, CSIRO-Mk3-6-0, FIO-ESM, GFDL-CM3, GFDL-ESM2G, GFDL-ESM2M, GISS-E2-R, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-ES, IPSL-CM5A-LR, MIROC5, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, MIROC-ESM, MRI-CGCM3, NorESM1-ME, and NorESM1-M.\r\n5. At each grid point, the difference in projected temperature was calculated for 2071-2099 minus 1970-1999.\r\n6. Data were plotted for grid points in North America.",
