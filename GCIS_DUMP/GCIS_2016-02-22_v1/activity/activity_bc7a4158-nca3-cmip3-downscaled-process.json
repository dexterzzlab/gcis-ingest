For each model at each grid point, the number of nights with a minimum temperature exceeding the historical (1971-2000) 98th percentile, under the higher emissions scenario (A2), was calculated for two periods: 1971-2000 and 2070-2099.\r\n3. At each grid point, the mean number of nights with a minimum temperature exceeding the historical 98th percentile for the two time periods was computed by averaging the following models:\r\n- cgcm3_t47\r\n- cgcm3_t63\r\n- cnrm\r\n- echam5\r\n- echo\r\n- gfdl_2.1\r\n- hadcm3\r\n- pcm\r\n4. At each grid point, the difference in the number of nights with a minimum temperature exceeding the historical 98th percentile was calculated for 2070-2099 minus 1971-2000.\r\n5. Data were plotted for all grid points.",
