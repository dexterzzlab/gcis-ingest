    "methodology": "The mean temperature for the period 1961-1990 was added to the global average annual temperature anomalies to get the annual temperature time series. For each grid point, the temperature trend for the period 1901-2012 was calculated and plotted on a map (as degrees per decade). The statistical significance was then calculated, and where trends were significant at the 2-tailed 10% significance level those grid points were indicated by a plus sign.",
