    "methodology": "1. For each model at each grid point, the mean fall precipitation under the higher emissions scenario (A2) was calculated.\r\n2. For each model, these data were re-gridded to a common grid.\r\n3. For each model at each grid point, the mean fall precipitation under the higher emissions scenario (A2) was calculated for two periods: 1970-1999 and 2070-2099.\r\n4. At each grid point, the mean fall precipitation for the two periods was computed by averaging the following models:\r\nCCSM3, CGCM3.1 (T47), CNRM-CM3, CSIRO-Mk3.0, ECHAM5/MPI-OM, ECHO-G, GFDL-CM2.0, GFDL-CM2.1, INM-CM3.0, IPSL-CM4, MIROC3.2 (medres), MRI-CGCM2.3.2, PCM, UKMO-HadCM3, and UKMO-HadGEM1\r\n5. At each grid point, the difference in projected fall precipitation was calculated for 2070-2099 minus 1970-1999.\r\n6. Data were plotted for grid points in North America with hatching/white-out applied as follows:\r\nIf the average change is twice as large as the average 20-year standard deviation from the reference period model run and 90% of the models agree in sign, then hatching is applied to those grid points. If the average change is less than the average 20-year standard deviation from the reference period model run, then those grid points are whited out (Methodology as used in IPCC AR5 WG1 report, chapter 12).",
