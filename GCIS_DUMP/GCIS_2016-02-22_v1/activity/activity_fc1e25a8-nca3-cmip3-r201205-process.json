    "methodology": "1. For each model at each grid point, the mean annual temperature under the B1 emissions scenario was calculated.\r\n2. For each model, these data were re-gridded to a common grid.\r\n3. For each model at each grid point, the mean annual temperature under the B1 scenario for 2071-2099 was calculated for the same subset of CMIP3 models under historical scenario for 1970-1999.\r\n4. At each grid point, the mean temperature for the two periods was computed by averaging the following models:\r\nBCCR_BCM2.0, CCSM3, CGCM3.1 (T47), CGCM3.1 (T63), CNRM-CM3, CSIRO-Mk3.0, ECHAM5/MPI-OM, ECHO-G, FGOALS-g1.0, GFDL-CM2.0, GFDL-CM2.1, GISS-AOM, GISS-ER, INM-CM3.0, IPSL-CM4, MIROC3.2 (hires), MIROC3.2 (medres), MRI-CGCM2.3.2, PCM, UKMO-HadCM3.\r\n5. At each grid point, the difference in projected temperature was calculated for 2071-2099 minus 1970-1999.\r\n6. Data were plotted for grid points in North America.",
