    "methodology": "1. For each model at each grid point, the mean annual precipitation under the RCP 8.5 scenario was calculated.\r\n2. For each model, these data were re-gridded to a common grid.\r\n3. For each model at each grid point, the mean precipitation under the RCP 8.5 scenario was calculated for two periods: 1970-1999 and 2071-2099.\r\n4. At each grid point, the mean precipitation for the two periods was computed by averaging the following models:\r\nACCESS1-0, ACCESS1-3, bcc-csm1-1, BNU-ESM, CanESM2, CCSM4, CESM1-BGC, CESM1-CAM5, CNRM-CM5, CSIRO-Mk3-6-0, EC-EARTH, FGOALS-g2, FIO-ESM, GFDL-CM3, GFDL-ESM2G, GFDL-ESM2M, GISS-E2-Rp1, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-CC, HadGEM2-ES, inmcm4, IPSL-CM5A-LR, IPSL-CM5A-MR, MIROC5, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, MIROC-ESM, MPI-ESM-LR, MPI-ESM-MR, MRI-CGCM3, NorESM1-ME, and NorESM1-M.\r\n5. At each grid point, the difference in projected precipitation was calculated for 2071-2099 minus 1970-1999.\r\n6. Data were plotted for all global grid points with hatching/white-out applied as follows:\r\nIf the average change is twice as large as the average 20-year standard deviation from the reference period model run and 90% of the models agree in sign, then hatching is applied to those grid points. If the average change is less than the average 20-year standard deviation from the reference period model run, then those grid points are whited out (Methodology as used in IPCC AR5 WG1 report, chapter 12).",
