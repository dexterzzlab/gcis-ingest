    "methodology": "The data were taken from Table ES-5 in: Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990-2011 (April 2013) EPA 430-R-13-001 (http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/usinventoryreport/archive.htm). The data for Table ES-5 were downloaded from the Main Report Tables: http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/Downloads/ghgemissions/1990-2011-US-GHG-Inventory-Report-Tables.zip.  \r\n\r\nData were multiplied by negative one, so that positive values indicate net sequestration and negative values indicate carbon dioxide released. Forests data match the \u201cForest Land Remaining Forest Land\u201d category in Table ES-5. Urban forests data match the \u201cSettlements Remaining Settlements\u201d category. Croplands and grasslands are the sum of these four categories: \u201cCropland Remaining Cropland\u201d, \u201cLand Converted to Cropland\u201d, \u201cGrassland Remaining Grassland\u201d, and \u201cLand Converted to Grassland\u201d.  \r\n\r\nData used are from January 1, 1990 to December 31, 2011.\r\n\r\nThe data was accessed on November 7, 2014.",
