    "methodology": "The mean precipitation for the period 1961-1990 was added to the global average annual precipitation anomalies to get the annual precipitation time series. For each grid point, the precipitation trend for the period 1979-2012 was calculated and plotted on a map (as inches per decade). The statistical significance was then calculated, and where trends were significant at the 2-tailed 10% significance level those grid points were indicated by a plus sign.",
