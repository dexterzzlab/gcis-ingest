    "summary": "The Roundtable (RT) brought together people who have extensive experience with the climate change issue, including those with knowledge of the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) and the longer-running U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP). The participants were asked to reflect on their experiences with global change science, and the decisions underpinned by this science. They were encouraged to look to the future and provide ideas about how the program may address new challenges in the sciences and in the application of knowledge to solve climate change problems. Information gained from the RT discussion will be extremely helpful to effectively transition the Program to the next Administration, and to ensure that federally supported science is responsive to emerging scientific opportunities and societal needs.",
