    "description": "EO-1 is a technology demonstration mission in NASA's NMP (New Millennium Program) Earth science program (a Landsat-7 follow-up) with the overall objectives to perform Landsat-like measurements and to explore new remote sensing technologies (instruments, spacecraft, ground segment) that advance and enhance capabilities [evaluation/validation of technologies and performance, intersatellite calibration (comparison of data), evaluation of lunar calibration, autonomous navigation/instrument operation, use of proven new technologies for other missions]. A number of baseline validation scenarios are defined (generation of test scenes, ground proofs in conjunction with major field campaigns, airborne underflights, tandem flights with Landsat-7, etc.) in support of the overall objectives. S/C design life = 1 year. The paradigm of \u201cfaster, better and cheaper\u201d applies to all aspects of the mission.",
