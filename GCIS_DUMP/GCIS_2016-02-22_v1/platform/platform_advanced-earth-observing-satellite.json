    "description": "ADEOS (Midori) is the first Japanese (NASDA) satellite mission with international cooperation. In Japan, the ADEOS satellite is also referred to as `Midori', meaning `green'. The overall objective of the mission is dedicated to Earth environmental research: integrated observation of geophysical parameters, global observation of land, ocean and atmospheric processes (ocean color and sea surface temperature). In addition, communication demonstrations are planned for the study (feasibility) of interorbit links, called IOCS (Inter-Orbital Communication Subsystem).",
