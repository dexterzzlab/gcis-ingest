    "description": "ACRIMSAT is a NASA funded minisatellite mission to monitor the amount of total solar energy received (part of EOS program). The objective is to monitor the solar constant, or TSI (Total Solar Irradiation), with maximum precision and provide an important link in the long-term TSI database. ACRIMSAT is part of a multi-decade effort to understand variations in the sun's output and resulting effects on Earth.",
