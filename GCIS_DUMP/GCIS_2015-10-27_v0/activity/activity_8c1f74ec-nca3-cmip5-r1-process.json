For each model, these data were re-gridded to a common grid.\r\n3. For each model at each grid point, the mean annual temperature was calculated under the RCP 4.5 scenario for 2071-2099 and under the historical scenario for 1970-1999 for the same subset of CMIP5 models.\r\n4. At each grid point, the mean temperature for the two periods was computed by averaging the following models:\r\nACCESS1-0, ACCESS1-3, bcc-csm1-1, CanESM2, CCSM4, CESM1-BGC, CESM1-CAM5, CMCC-CM, CNRM-CM5, CSIRO-Mk3-6-0, EC-EARTH, FGOALS-g2, FGOALS-s2, FIO-ESM, GFDL-CM3, GFDL-ESM2G, GFDL-ESM2M, GISS-E2-R_p1, GISS-E2-R_p2, GISS-E2-R_p3, HadGEM2-CC, HadGEM2-ES, inmcm4, IPSL-CM5A-LR, IPSL-CM5A-MR, MIROC5, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, MIROC-ESM, MPI-ESM-LR, MPI-ESM-MR, MRI-CGCM3, NorESM1-ME, and NorESM1-M.\r\n5. At each grid point, the difference in projected temperature was calculated for 2071-2099 minus 1970-1999.\r\n6. Data were plotted for grid points in North America.",
