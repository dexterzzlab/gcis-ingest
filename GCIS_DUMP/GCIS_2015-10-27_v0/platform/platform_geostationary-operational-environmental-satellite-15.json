    "description": "For a number of years the designation GOES-Next (N) was used to identify the first of the satellites that would follow the GOES I-M series. It was also thought this GOES-N would be the start of a totally new generation satellite series. However, during the time frame of about 1992-95, NOAA and NASA have come to realize that a new generation satellite series would take at least a decade to define, develop, manufacture, and to launch. This new situation made both parties (NOAA, NASA) realize it would need a few more clones of the current GOES I-M series to maintain continuity of GOES service prior to the GOES Next being available.",
