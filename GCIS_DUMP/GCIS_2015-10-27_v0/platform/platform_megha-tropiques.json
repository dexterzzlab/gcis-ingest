    "description": "Megha-Tropiques (or MT) is a cooperative experimental mission of ISRO and CNES, the space agencies of India and France, with the objective to study the convective systems (water cycle and energetic exchanges) that affect the ITCZ (Intertropical Convergence Zone), in particular in the latitudes between 10\u00ba and 20\u00ba, with satisfactory temporal sampling. The most energetic tropical systems, such as the cloud clusters of the ITCZ, the monsoon systems and the tropical cyclones, extend over hundreds of kilometers. Hence, a ground resolution of about 10 km is adequate for these observations. Megha-Tropiques, with its unique combination of scientific payloads and its special near-equatorial orbit (offering improved data sampling of the ITCZ), is expected to provide valuable data for climate research. - Note: Megha means \u201ccloud\u201d in Sanskrit; Tropiques is the French word for \u201ctropics.\u201d",
