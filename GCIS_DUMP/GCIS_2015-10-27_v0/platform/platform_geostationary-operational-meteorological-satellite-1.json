    "description": "GOMS-1, also referred to as (and a spelling of Elektro-1), is the first (experimental) geostationary weather satellite of Russia. Initial program planning started in the early 1970s (the VPK Military-Industrial Commission requested development of a unified meteorological system to be operational by 1979), and continued through the 1980s [involvement of ROSHYDROMET (Committee for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring) and other institutions in Russia]. The program's numerous delays were due to both equipment and software problems.",
