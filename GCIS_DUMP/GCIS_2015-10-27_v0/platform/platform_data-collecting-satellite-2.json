    "description": "The SCD satellite program of INPE (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais) or \u201cNational Institute of Space Research\u201d is to provide a spaceborne environmental data collecting capability for Brazil. This program is considered complimentary to the Argos DCS (Data Collection System) flown on the POES (Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite) series of NOAA, USA. Most data collected by the SCD spacecraft are related to meteorological and hydrological phenomena, gathered and transmitted by around 700 terrestrial data collecting platforms (DCP's) spread over the country (and some platforms installed in other South America countries).",
