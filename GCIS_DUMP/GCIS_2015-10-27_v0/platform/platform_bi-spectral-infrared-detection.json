    "description": "BIRD is a DLR (German Aerospace Center) microsatellite technology demonstration mission with the overall objectives to observe fires/hot spots on Earth (caused by lightning, volcanism, oil wells, smoke/water-cloud discrimination, and by man) to permit environmental impact studies. Secondary objectives involve technology demonstrations, namely the operation of a new type of infrared sensor system on a microsatellite and on-board preprocessing techniques.",
