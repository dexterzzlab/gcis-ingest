    "description": "Meteosat is the European meteorological program in GEO (Geostationary Orbit) that was initiated in 1972 by ESRO (European Space Research Organization). ESRO was founded in 1962 and served as predecessor organization to ESA (European Space Agency) which was founded in 1975. Actually the beginnings of European space meteorology goes back to 1968 when CNES, the young French national space agency, proposed to ESRO to \u201cEuropeanize\u201d its \u201cMeteosat\u201d concept. The proposal was accepted in 1972 and 8 Member States decided to finance the Meteosat Preoperational Program (Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Switzerland).",
