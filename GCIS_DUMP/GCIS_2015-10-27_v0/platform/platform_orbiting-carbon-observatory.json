    "description": "OCO is a NASA sponsored minisatellite mission selected in July 2002 within the ESSP (Earth System Science Pathfinder) program. The OCO science objective is to provide global measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO ) needed to describe the geographic distribution and variability of carbon dioxide sources and sinks. CO measurements are essential to resolving significant discrepancies in our understanding of the global carbon budget and, hence, humankind's role in global climate change.",
