    "description": "OCO-2 is a NASA mission dedicated to studying atmospheric carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is the leading human-produced greenhouse gas driving changes in the Earth's climate. OCO-2 will provide a complete picture of human and natural carbon dioxide sources and \"sinks,\" the places where the gas is pulled out of the atmosphere and stored. The aim is to map the global geographic distribution of these sources and sinks and study their changes over time.",
