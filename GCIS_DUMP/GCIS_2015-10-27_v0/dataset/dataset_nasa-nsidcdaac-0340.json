    "description": "This data set includes data collected over the Soil Moisture Experiment 2004 (SMEX04) area of Sonora, Mexico during 1 June to 30 September 2004. The SeaWinds scatterometer on NASA's Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) satellite collected backscatter data. Data are provided in Brigham Young University - Microwave Earth Remote Sensing (BYU-MERS) Scatterometer Image Reconstruction (SIR) images and Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) images, and are available via FTP. These data were collected as part of a validation study for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). AMSR-E is a mission instrument launched aboard NASA's Aqua Satellite on 04 May 2002. AMSR-E validation studies linked to SMEX are designed to evaluate the accuracy of AMSR-E soil moisture data. Specific validation objectives include assessing and refining soil moisture algorithm performance; verifying soil moisture estimation accuracy; investigating the effects of vegetation, surface temperature, topography, and soil texture on soil moisture accuracy; and determining the regions that are useful for AMSR-E soil moisture measurements.",
