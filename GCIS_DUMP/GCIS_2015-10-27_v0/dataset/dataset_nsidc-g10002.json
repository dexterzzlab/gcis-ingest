    "description": "This data set consists of glacier regime parameters observed between 1945 and 2003. Data include annual mass balances, ablation, accumulation, and equilibrium-line altitude of mountain and subpolar glaciers outside the two major ice sheets. All available sources of information, such as publications, archived data, and personal communications have been collected, and include time series of more than 300 glaciers. Data have been digitized and quality checked. The data are available on CD-ROM from the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR) when a hardcopy of INSTAAR Occasional Paper #55 is ordered, or on FTP from NSIDC.",
