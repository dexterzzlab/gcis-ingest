    "description": "Notice to Data Users: The documentation for this data set was provided solely by the Principal Investigator(s) and was not further developed, thoroughly reviewed, or edited by NSIDC. Thus, support for this data set may be limited. This data set contains Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery of the Alaska, USA area, complementing the joint in situ and aircraft Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer Sea Ice Product Validation (AMSRIce03) campaign conducted in March 2003. The images are visible imagery collected 13, 15, 16, 19, 20 and 22 March 2003. The total volume of this data set is approximately 3 gigabytes. Data are provided in binary image files with corresponding Environment for Visualizing Images (ENVI) header files, and are available via FTP. These data were collected as part of a validation study for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). AMSR-E is a mission instrument launched aboard NASA's Aqua Satellite on 04 May 2002.",
