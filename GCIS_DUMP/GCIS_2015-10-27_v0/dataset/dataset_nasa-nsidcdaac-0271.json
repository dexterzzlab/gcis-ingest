    "description": "This data set comprises global, monthly satellite-derived Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) climatologies from November 1978 through May 2007, with periodic updates released as resources permit. Global data are gridded to the Northern and Southern 25 km Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grids (EASE-Grids). Global snow water equivalent is derived from Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) and selected Special Sensor Microwave/Imagers (SSM/I). Northern Hemisphere data are enhanced with snow cover frequencies derived from the Northern Hemisphere EASE-Grid Weekly Snow Cover and Sea Ice Extent Version 2 data (these data were not produced for the Southern Hemisphere). These data are suitable for continental-scale time-series studies of snow cover and water equivalent. The data are binary data files and PNG images, and are available via FTP.",
