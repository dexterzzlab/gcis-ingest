    "description": "ABSTRACT: The level-1a BOREAS GOES-7 image data was collected by Remote Sensing Science Team 14 (RSS-14) personnel at the Florida State University and processed to level-1a products by BORIS personnel. The primary objective for the GOES-7 images in 1994 was to collect visible, infrared (IR), and water vapor channel data covering the BOREAS region at a sufficiently high temporal frequency for subsequent use in analyzing weather events and deriving temporal surface radiation parameters and patterns that existed during the Focused and Intensive Field Campaigns (FFCs and IFCs). The transition and shifting of satellites from GOES-7 to GOES-8 in 1995 enabled good quality images to be acquired over the BOREAS region four times per day from January to June, giving a reasonable monitoring dataset. The data cover the period of 01-January-1994 through 08-July-1995 with partial to complete coverage on the majority of the days. The data include three-bands with eight-bit pixel values. No major problems with the data have been identified.",
