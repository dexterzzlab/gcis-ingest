    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set reports the measurement of stable carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen isotope ratios in organic material (plant, litter and soil samples) in forest canopy profiles and pasture (grasses and shrubs) as well as corresponding carbon and nitrogen tissue concentrations in a number of different sites across Brazil. The sampling design captured the temporal variation in rainfall over the course of several years. Carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios can act as a proxy for interpreting aspects of the carbon and nitrogen cycles in Amazonian rainforests. Data are in three comma-delimited ASCII files.",
