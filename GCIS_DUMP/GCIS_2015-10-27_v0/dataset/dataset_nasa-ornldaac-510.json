    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set is a condensed forest cover type digital map of Saskatchewan and is a product of the Saskatchewan Environment and Resource Management, Forestry Branch - Inventory Unit (SERM-FBIU). This map was generalized from SERM township maps of vegetation cover at an approximate scale of 1:63,000 (1 in. = 1 mile). The cover information was iteratively generalized until it was compiled on a 1:1,000,000 scale map base. This data set was prepared by SERM-FBIU. The data is a condensed forest cover type map of Saskatchewan at a scale of 1:1,000,000.",
