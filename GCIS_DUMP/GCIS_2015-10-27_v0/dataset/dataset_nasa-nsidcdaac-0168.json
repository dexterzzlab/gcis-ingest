    "description": "This data set includes two sets of soil temperature profiles, two sets of soil moisture profiles, two sets of soil heat flux profiles (in dense pine and open pine areas), and one set of a snow temperature profile, air temperature, and relative humidity measurements. Measurements were made at the Local Scale Observation Site (LSOS) of the Cold Land Processes Field Experiment (CLPX) in northern Colorado. The LSOS is a 100 m x 100 m study site located within the Fraser Intensive Study Area (ISA). The study area has flat topography with a uniform pine forest, a discontinuous pine forest, and a small clearing. Data were collected between 6 November 2002 and 29 May 2003. These data were primarily collected to support the University of Michigan microwave radiometric observations acquired at the same site (to be published in early 2004).",
