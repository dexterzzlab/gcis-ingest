    "description": "This dataset contains operational near-real-time Level 2 ocean surface wind vector retrievals from the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) on MetOp-B at 25 km sampling resolution (note: the effective resolution is 50 km). It is a product of the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) provided through the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI). The wind vector retrievals are currently processed using the CMOD.n geophysical model function using a Hamming filter to spatially average the Sigma-0 data in the ASCAT L1B data. Each file is provided in netCDF version 3 format, and contains one full orbit derived from 3-minute orbit granules. Latency is approximately 2 hours from the latest measurement. The beginning of the orbit is defined by the first wind vector cell measurement within the first 3-minute orbit granule that starts north of the Equator in the ascending node. ASCAT is a C-band dual swath fan beam radar scatterometer providing two independent swaths of backscatter retrievals in sun-synchronous polar orbit aboard the MetOp-B platform. For more information on the MetOp-B mission, please visit: http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/OceanWind/MetOp .
