    "description": "This data set contains geolocated surface elevation measurements captured over Antarctica using the Sigma Space Mapping Photon Counting Lidar and Riegl Laser Altimeter. The data were collected by scientists working on the International Collaborative Exploration of the Cryosphere through Airborne Profiling (ICECAP) project, which was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Collaborative Research Center, and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) with additional support from NASA Operation IceBridge.",
