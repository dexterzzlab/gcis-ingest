    "description": "Notice to Data Users: The documentation for this data set was provided solely by the Principal Investigator(s) and was not further developed, thoroughly reviewed, or edited by NSIDC. Thus, support for this data set may be limited. This data set contains surface reflectance measurements acquired on 25 August 2004 over the Soil Moisture Experiment 2004 (SMEX04) regional study area in Arizona, USA. The Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) instrument was mounted on an ER-2 aircraft that flew over the area approximately 20 km above sea level. From this altitude, the resulting pixel size is approximately 20 m by 20 m and the swath width is approximately 10.5 km. Data were acquired from seven southbound flights over the study area to determine canopy water content. Total volume for this data set is approximately 14 gigabytes. Data are provided in binary files and tab-delimited ASCII text files. A JPEG file indicating each flightline is also provided. All files are available via FTP. These data were collected as part of a validation study for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). AMSR-E is a mission instrument launched aboard NASA's Aqua Satellite on 04 May 2002. AMSR-E validation studies linked to SMEX are designed to evaluate the accuracy of AMSR-E soil moisture data. Specific validation objectives include assessing and refining soil moisture algorithm performance; verifying soil moisture estimation accuracy; investigating the effects of vegetation, surface temperature, topography, and soil texture on soil moisture accuracy; and determining the regions that are useful for AMSR-E soil moisture measurements.",
