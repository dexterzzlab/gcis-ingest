    "description": "ABSTRACT: The BOREAS HYD-03 team collected several data sets related to the hydrology of forested areas. This data set contains measurements of stem density from a variety of sites. Stem density measurements were made during the FFC-W 1996 in the SSA only using standard techniques. This study was undertaken to predict spatial distributions of energy transfer, snow properties important to the hydrology, remote sensing signatures, and transmissivity of gases through the snow and their relation to forests in boreal ecosystems.",
