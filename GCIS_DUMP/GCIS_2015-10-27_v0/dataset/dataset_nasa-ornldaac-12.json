    "description": "ABSTRACT: As part of the FIFE staff science data collection effort, the FIFE Information System (FIS) processed and archived 5 minute, near-surface radiometric and meteorological information collected by the Automated Meteorological Stations (AMS) distributed over the FIFE study area. The FIFE AMS Data Set contains the two output products created. The level-1 product contains unpacked 5 minute data. The level-1a product contains 30 minute averages of these data. All AMS stations were equipped to measure air temperature, humidity, wind speed, soil temperature, reflected solar radiation, net radiation, surface temperature, and precipitation. Two stations were augmented with extra radiation sensors to become super-AMS (SAMS). These stations measured total radiation, direct solar radiation, diffuse solar radiation, photosynthetically active radiation, and downward longwave radiation.",
