    "description": "The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) instrument on the NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) Aqua satellite provides global passive microwave measurements of terrestrial, oceanic, and atmospheric variables for the investigation of global water and energy cycles. The AMSR-E Level-2A product (AE_L2A) contains brightness temperatures at 6.9 GHz, 10.7 GHz, 18.7 GHz, 23.8 GHz, 36.5 GHz, and 89.0 GHz. Data are resampled to be spatially consistent, and therefore are available at a variety of resolutions that correspond to the footprint sizes of the observations such as 56 km, 38 km, 21 km, 12 km, and 5.4 km, respectively. Each swath is packaged with associated geolocation fields. Data are stored in Hierarchical Data Format - Earth Observing System (HDF-EOS) format and are available from 1 June 2002 to 4 October 2011 via FTP.",
