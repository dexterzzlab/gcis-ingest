    "description": "ABSTRACT: The Bowen Ratio Surface Flux Observations (GSFC) Data Set contains data collected using the Bowen Ratio Techniques. The major data collection effort was conducted in 1987 when 16 stationary sites were equipped with Bowen ratio equipment by different groups. Surface flux measurements were made at selected sites within the FIFE area. All measurements are from a single upland site that was grazed. This station measured the fluxes of net radiation, sensible heat, and latent heat and several micrometeorological parameters.",
