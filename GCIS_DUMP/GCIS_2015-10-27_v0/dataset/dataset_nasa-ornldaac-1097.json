    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set reports delta 13C/12C results for leaf tissues and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), 15N/14N ratios for leaf tissue, and leaf carbon and nitrogen concentrations along a topographical gradient in old-growth forests in the ZF2 Reserve (km 34), Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia (INPA), near Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil. During the dry seasons of 2004 and 2006, leaves were sampled at various heights within the canopy and atmospheric air flask samples were also collected at various heights at three locations along this gradient. Also included are coincident meteorological, atmospheric CO2, and CO2 flux measurements from the plateau KM34 tower. There are 3 comma-delimited data files with this data set.",
