    "description": "ABSTRACT: Point data developed from in situ observations at four flux tower sites were combined to produce continuous, above the canopy, meteorological forcing data sets. Data from the OA and OBS sites in the SSA and the Fen and OBS sites in the NSA were used to create continuous time series with a time step of one hour, covering the period from 1-Jan-1994 through 1-Dec-1996. Meteorological variables of interest are surface air pressure, air temperature, dew point temperature, wind speed, wind direction, precipitation, incoming solar (shortwave) radiation, and incoming infrared (longwave) radiation.",
