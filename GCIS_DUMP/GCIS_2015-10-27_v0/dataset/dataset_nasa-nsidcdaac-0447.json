    "description": "This data set consists of Northern Hemisphere snow depth analysis data processed by the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC). Snow depth data obtained from surface synoptic observations (synops), meteorological aviation reports (metars), and special aviation reports (SAs) were acquired from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) information system for use in the CMC analyses. This CMC data set includes daily observations from 1998 through 2014 and will be updated annually. Monthly averages and monthly climatologies of snow depth and estimated Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) are provided, where SWE was estimated using a density look-up table. The volume of the data set is approximately four gigabytes. Data are provided in tab-delimited ASCII text files and are available via FTP.",
