    "description": "The NASA IceBridge Sigma Space Photon Counting Lidar L2 Geolocated Nadir Photon Elevations (ILSNP2) data set contains geolocated surface elevation data captured over Antarctica using the Sigma Space photon counting lidar. Along track and across track range vector location data are included. The data were collected by scientists working on the Investigating the Cryospheric Evolution of the Central Antarctic Plate (ICECAP) project, which is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) with additional support from NASA Operation IceBridge. The data are ASCII text files and are available via FTP for periodic, ongoing campaigns from 29 November 2011 to the present.",
