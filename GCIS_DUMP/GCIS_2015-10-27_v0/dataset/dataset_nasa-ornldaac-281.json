    "description": "ABSTRACT: The level-0 AOCI imagery, along with the other remotely sensed images, was collected to provide spatially extensive information about radiant energy over the primary BOREAS study areas. The AOCI was the only remote sensing instrument flown with wavelength bands specific to the investigation of various aquatic parameters such as chlorophyll content and turbidity. Only one flight of the AOCI instrument was made onboard the ER-2 aircraft on 21-Jul-1994 over the SSA. Companion files include (1) an image inventory listing to inform users of the images that are available and (2) example thumbnail images that may be viewed and the image data files downloaded using a convenient viewer utility.",
