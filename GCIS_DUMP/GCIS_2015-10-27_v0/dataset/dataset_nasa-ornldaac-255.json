    "description": "ABSTRACT: The BOREAS HYD-01 team made measurements of volumetric soil moisture at the SSA and NSA tower flux sites in 1994 and at selected tower flux sites in 1995-97. Different methods were used to collect these measurements, including neutron probe and manual and automated TDR. In 1994, the measurements were made every other day at the NSA-OJP, NSA-YJP, NSA-OBS, NSA-Fen, SSA-OJP, SSA-YJP, SSA-Fen, SSA-YA, and SSA-OBS sites. In 1995-97, when automated equipment was deployed at NSA-OJP, NSA-YJP, NSA-OBS, SSA-OBS, and SSA-OA, the measurements were made as often as every hour.",
