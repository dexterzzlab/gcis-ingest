    "description": "ABSTRACT: The FLUAMAZON Experiment data set includes meteorological data collected with radiosondes to examine the moisture flux from the northern coast of South America (near the mouth of the Amazon River) into central Amazonia. The measurements were collected from November 23, to December 21, 1989 during the period of transition between the dry and humid seasons in the region. Some of the studies performed with data from FLUAMAZON were related to the atmospheric thermodynamic structure over Amazonia. During FLUAMAZON, radiosonde measurements were made simultaneously in five different locations: Alcantara, Belem, Oiapoque, Manaus, and Alta Floresta. ASCII text data files for each location have been compiled and compressed into site-specific zipped files.",
