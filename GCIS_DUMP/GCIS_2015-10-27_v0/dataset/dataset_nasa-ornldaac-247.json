    "description": "ABSTRACT: The level-0 Daedalus TMS imagery, along with the other remotely sensed images, was collected to provide spatially extensive information about radiant energy over the primary BOREAS study areas. This information includes detailed land cover and biophysical parameter maps such as FPAR and LAI. Two flights of the Daedalus TMS instrument were made onboard the ER-2 aircraft on September 16 and 17, 1994. Companion files include (1) an image inventory listing to inform users of the images that are available and (2) example thumbnail images that may be viewed and the image data files downloaded using a convenient viewer utility.",
