    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set contains Landsat TM imagery for the years 1986, 1989, 1996, and 1999, that have been classified into four land use/land cover (LULC) classes: Forest, Non-Forest Vegetation, Urban/Barren, and Water; and a fifth class of Clouds/Shadows. The areas of interest were the four Intensive Study Areas (ISA) of the University of North Carolina's Carolina Population Center (CPC) Ecuador Projects: Eastern Intensive Study Area; Northern Intensive Study Area; Southern Intensive Study Area, and Southwestern Intensive Study Area. These areas are in the Northern Ecuadorian Amazon, in the area known as the northern Oriente of Ecuador. The resolution of the data is 30 meters. There are 12 image files (.tif) with this data set.",
