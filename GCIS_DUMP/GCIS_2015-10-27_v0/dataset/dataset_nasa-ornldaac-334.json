    "description": "ABSTRACT: The BOREAS TE-07 team collected data sets in support of its efforts to characterize and interpret information on the sap flow of boreal vegetation. The heat pulse method was used to monitor sap flow and to estimate rates of transpiration from aspen, black spruce, and mixed wood forests at the SSA-OA, MIX, SSA-OBS, and Batoche sites in Saskatchewan, Canada. Measurements were made at the various sites from May to Oct 1994, May to Oct 1995, and Apr to Oct 1996. A scaling procedure was used to estimate canopy transpiration rates from the sap flow measurements.",
