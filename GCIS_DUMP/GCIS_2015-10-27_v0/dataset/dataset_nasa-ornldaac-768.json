    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set contains leaf area index (LAI), leaf inclination angle, and canopy dimension data from study sites along the Kalahari Transect in southwest Botswana. The data were collected during the 2001 wet season field campaign of the SAFARI 2000 at a total of seven plots of 200 x 150 meter dimensions; two plots each at Tshane and Mabuasehube, and three plots at Tsabong. The data set consists of measurements of leaf angle for plot dominant woody species, LAI calculated from overstory and understory photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) measurements, and canopy dimension data (i. e., crown height, crown width, and height to crown) for grass and woody vegetation, for use in the parameterization of plant canopy reflectance models.Measurements of LAI were made with a plant canopy analyzer which records direct and diffuse PAR at the top of the canopy using a beam fraction sensor. PAR beneath the canopy was measured simultaneously with a one-meter long probe held horizontally beneath the canopy. Leaf inclination angle measurements were made using a clinometer. Measurements of tree height, crown height, height-to-crown, and crown width were made for 10 to 20 individual trees of the dominant species at each field plot using a tape measure or simple trigonometry, and calculations based on these data.The data files are stored as ASCII table files, in comma-separated-value (.csv) format, with column headers. Photographs (.jpg) are provided of each plot to provide an idea of site conditions. The photographs can be viewed on the S2K Photo Gallery pages.",
