    "description": "This data set combines data for several parameters measured for the Soil Moisture Experiment 2003 (SMEX03). The parameters include bulk density, gravimetric and volumetric soil moisture, and surface and subsurface soil temperature. This study was conducted between 2 July 2003 and 17 July 2003 in the Little Washita watershed in Oklahoma, USA. Data were collected using a variety of methods and sensors. Data are formatted as ASCII text, and are available via FTP. These data were collected as part of a validation study for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). AMSR-E is a mission instrument launched aboard NASA's Aqua Satellite on 04 May 2002. AMSR-E validation studies linked to SMEX are designed to evaluate the accuracy of AMSR-E soil moisture data. Specific validation objectives include assessing and refining soil moisture algorithm performance; verifying soil moisture estimation accuracy; investigating the effects of vegetation, surface temperature, topography, and soil texture on soil moisture accuracy; and determining the regions that are useful for AMSR-E soil moisture measurements.",
