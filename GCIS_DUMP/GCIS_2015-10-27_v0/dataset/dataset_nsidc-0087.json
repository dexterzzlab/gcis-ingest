    "description": "Information from snow pits and an ice core were collected at Dominion Range (location - 166 10' East, 85 15' South, elevation - 2,700m) in 1984-1985. The 6 meter snow pit was dug and sampled in 1984-1985 with a 3 cm sampling interval. Four 1 meter snow pits were dug and sampled in 1984-1985 with a 3 cm sampling interval. One core was drilled during the austral summer 1984-1985 with a depth of 160 meters. Chemistry and density data were collected from the 1 meter pits. Chemistry, beta profile and density data were collected from the 6 meter snow pits. Chemistry (Na NH4, K, Mg, Ca, Cl, NO3, SO4, MSA), particles and a lead-210 profile were collected from the ice core.",
