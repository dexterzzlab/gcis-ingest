    "description": "This data set consists of Upward Looking Sonar (ULS) data from 11 moorings in the Greenland Sea. Parameters in the processed data files include ice draft, water pressure, and water temperature. Raw data files with sonar travel time, and files with draft frequency of occurrence, are available as well. A single statistical file for each mooring summarizes that mooring's record. These data were contributed by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research, Bremerhaven, Germany, in 2002 and 2004, as a contribution to the World Climate Research Programme's Arctic Climate System Study/Climate and Cryosphere (ACSYS/CliC) Project. Data are available via FTP. NSIDC strongly encourages you to register as a user of this data product. As a registered user, you will be notified of updates and corrections.
