    "description": "This data set includes stable isotope measurements from snow pits, firn, and ice cores collected by the the US component of the International Trans-Antarctic Scientific Expedition ( ITASE). The ITASE program aims to collect and interpret a continental-wide array of environmental parameters assembled through the coordinated efforts of scientists from several nations. These data were collected between 1999 and 2007. The data have been compiled into single files for each sampling site, though in some cases a file contains data from more than one ice core or snow pit. Each file in the data set includes deuterium/hydrogen (&#948;D) and/or 18-oxygen/16-oxygen (&#948;18O) ratios, depths, and in some cases ice age or other information. Further details regarding the data are provided in each data file. Data are available via FTP in ASCII text format (.txt). Data were collected during five Antarctic field seasons from 1999 to 2007. Data from 1999 to 2002 are currently available. Data from 2003 to 2007 will be added in the future.",
