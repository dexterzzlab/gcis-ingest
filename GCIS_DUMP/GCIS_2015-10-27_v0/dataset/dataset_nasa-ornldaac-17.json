    "description": "ABSTRACT: The Volume Imaging LIDAR (VIL) system of the University of Wisconsin, operated during FIFE and all LIDAR return signals measured at a 90 degree elevation angle were averaged and stored in a file. From plots of those profiles, clouds up to 15 km AGL can be identified. By choosing appropriate reflectivity levels, the data from the University of Wisconsin LIDAR have been used to derive unique 2-D and 3-D views of the Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) structure and the variations in that structure with time. Some of these views are available in the GRAB BAG directory on FIFE CD-ROM Volume 1. Color videos were also produced and are available from the Archive listed in Section 13.1. These views and videos provide important insights into many problems facing investigators in all aspects of FIFE, including scaling and the representativeness of point and line samples.",
