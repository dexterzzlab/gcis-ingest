    "description": "This data set presents more than 400 sub-canopy digital thermograms collected at the Fraser Experimental Forest (Fraser, Colorado, USA) using an Infrared Solutions IR SnapShot&trade; thermoelectric thermal infrared (IR) imaging radiometer that was cold-weather modified. To view the data it is necessary to have the Infrared Solutions SnapView\u2122 software, which is available from Infrared Solutions. The NASA Cold Land Processes Field Experiment (CLPX) is a multi-sensor, multi-scale experiment that focuses on extending a local-scale understanding of water fluxes, storage, and transformations to regional and global scales. Within a framework of nested study areas in the central Rocky Mountains of the western United States, ranging from 1 ha to 160,000 km<sup>2</sup>, intensive ground, airborne, and spaceborne observations are collected. Data collection focuses on two seasons: mid-winter, when conditions are generally frozen and dry, and early spring, a transitional period when both frozen and thawed, dry and wet conditions are widespread.",
