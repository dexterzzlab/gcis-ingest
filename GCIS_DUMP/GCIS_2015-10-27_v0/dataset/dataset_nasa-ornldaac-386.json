    "description": "ABSTRACT: This raster format data set covers the province of Manitoba. The data were gridded into the AEAC projection from the original vector data. The original vector data were produced by Forestry Canada from hand-drawn boundaries of fires on photocopies of 1:250,000-scale maps. The locational accuracy of the data is considered fair to poor. When the locations of some fire boundaries were compared to Landsat TM images, they were found to be off by as much as a few kilometers. This problem should be kept in mind when using these data.",
