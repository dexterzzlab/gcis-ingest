    "description": "This data set provides a modeled radar attenuation rate profile, showing the predicted contributions from pure ice and impurities to radar attenuation at the Vostok 5G ice core site in Antarctica, as well as the total attenuation rate and its formal uncertainty. The model data are based on borehole temperature logs, concentrations of major soluble ions measured from melted ice core samples, and information about the electrical conductivity of ice. Attenuation rates and their spatial variability are important constraints for radar studies of ice sheets. Parameters include depth, total attenuation rate, and attenuation rate contribution from pure ice, acidity, and salinity. Data are available via FTP as a text file (.txt) with columns in comma separated value format.",
