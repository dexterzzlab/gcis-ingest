    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set contains the results of a biometric tree survey of a 19.25 ha area adjacent to the eddy flux tower at the km 83 logged forest tower site in Tapajos National Forest, Para, Brazil. The survey was done in March 2000. All measurements reported here were taken before the logging began. Diameters of all trees > 35 cm DBH within the 19.25 ha survey area were recorded and trees with DBH between 10 and 35 cm DBH were recorded along three transects with a total area of 2.3 ha (Miller et al., 2004). These data were used to calculate net ecosystem productivity (NEP) and the role of this forest as a carbon source or sink. Biometric data are reported in one comma-delimited ASCII file.",
