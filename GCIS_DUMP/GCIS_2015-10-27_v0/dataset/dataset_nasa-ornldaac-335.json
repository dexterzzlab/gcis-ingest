    "description": "ABSTRACT: The BOREAS TE-08 team collected pigment density data from aspen bark and leaves from four sites within the BOREAS SSA from 24-May-1994 to 16-Jun-1994 (IFC-1), 19-Jul-1994 to 08-Aug-1994 (IFC 2), and 30-Aug-1994 to 19-Sep-1994 (IFC-3). One to nine trees from each site were sampled during the three IFCs. Each tree was sampled in five different locations for bark pigment properties: basal stem section, which was any bark sample taken below one-half the tree height; upper stem section, which was any bark sample taken from the main stem above one-half the tree height; bark taken from branches up to 3 years old; a 2-year old branch segment; and a 1-year old branch segment. Additionally, a limited number of leaves were collected. Bark samples were removed from the stem of the tree, placed in ziplock bags, and transported to UNH, where they were processed and analyzed by a spectrophotometer. In each data file, samples are identified by Site, date, Tree#, and Sample Location (see 1st paragraph above). Pigment density values are normalized to mg/m2. Density values for the following pigments are provided: Chl a, Chl b, Total Chl (Chl a+b), Carotenoids, Chl a to b ratio, and the Total Chl to carotenoids ratio.",
