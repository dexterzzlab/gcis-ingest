    "description": "ABSTRACT: The BOREAS TGB-03 team collected Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) data during the summer of 1994 in the Northern Study Area. The purpose of this work was to establish the major sources, sinks and fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the Northern Study Area. Data on DOC concentrations taken from samples representing the major sources and sinks were to be combined with hydrologic measurements (e.g. precipitation, stream flow etc.) to calculate DOC fluxes.",
