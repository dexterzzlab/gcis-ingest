    "description": "This data set includes Level-1B1radiance (all angles), Level-1B2 georectified terrain, and Level-2 land surface, and an ancillary geographic product for the Large Regional Study Area (LRSA) of the Cold Land Processes Field Experiment (CLPX) in northern Colorado and southern Wyoming. Data were collected between 15 February and 15 May 2002 and the same time period in 2003. Data are available via FTP. The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) views Earth at nine widely spaced angles via radiometrically and geometrically calibrated images in four spectral bands at each of the nine angles, to provide global images with high spatial detail. Global spatial sampling is provided at 275 and 1100 meters. These images provide accurate measures of the brightness, contrast, and color of reflected sunlight.",
