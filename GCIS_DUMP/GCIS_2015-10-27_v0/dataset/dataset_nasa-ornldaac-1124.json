    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set reports the results of soil nitric oxide (NO) flux, soil moisture, and soil nitrate (NO3) and ammonium (NH4) concentration measurements on Cerrado soils receiving nitrogen fertilization. Measurements and samples were collected from control and fertillized experimental plots on Cerrado soils within the Ecological Reserve of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistic (IBGE), Brasilia, Brazil. Sampling dates were from March 26, 2004 to November 25, 2004. The soils had received nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization treatments which began in 1998. The objective of this project was to determine the long-term effects of nutrient addition (N and N+P) in native Cerrado area on N oxide fluxes from soil to the atmosphere. There is one comma delimited (.csv) ASCII file with this data set.",
