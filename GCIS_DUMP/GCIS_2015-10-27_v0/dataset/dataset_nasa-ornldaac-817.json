    "description": "ABSTRACT: PnET (Photosynthetic / EvapoTranspiration model) is a nested series of models of carbon, water, and nitrogen dynamics in forest ecosystems. The models can be used to predict transient responses in net primary production (NPP), carbon and water balances, net nitrogen (N) mineralization and nitrification and N leaching losses, resulting from changes in climate, N deposition, tropospheric ozone and land use as well as variation in species composition. The models have been developed and validated in the Northeastern U.S. at both the site and grid level (to 1-km resolution) at the Complex Systems Research Center, University of New Hampshire, by John Aber and colleagues.",
