    "description": "This data set consists of snow depth data from nine study areas, within three larger-scale areas in northern Colorado (Fraser, North Park, and Rabbit Ears Meso-cell Study Areas (MSAs)). The study areas range from low-relief (flat topography) unforested areas with shallow snow covers, to high-relief (complex topography) densely forested areas with deep snow covers. Parameters measured include snow depth, snow wetness, snow temperature, soil temperature, and canopy cover. Photos were taken of surface roughness and terrain. Data were collected during February and March 2002 and 2003. This data set is part of the NASA Cold Land Processes Field Experiment (CLPX).",
