    "description": "Ice cover data is available online for years 2003 through 2013 (partial data for 2012 and 2013). For each year, three types of products are available: original ice charts from the National Ice Center (ASCII files), graphic images of ice maps (jpg files) and ArcGIS feature classes for GIS users (shapefiles). This data is organized by 'ice year' rather than calendar year. For example, ice year 2011 begins with files from December 2010 and ends with May 2011.\r\n\r\nAll of these products were developed according to the standards used for the Great Lakes Ice Atlas for 1973-2002, ensuring that this time series of ice data is internally consistent. Although the ice charts and graphic files for 2003-2005 were released previously (Assel, 2005), they are included here for consistency with the addition of GIS files. For more documentation on this data set, see Wang et al., 2012, and, Assel et al., 2013.",
