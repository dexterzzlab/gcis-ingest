    "description": "ABSTRACT: The SE-590 Spectroradiometer Reflectance Factors from GSFC Data Set contains spectral data collected with the Spectron SE-590 Spectral Radiometer at selected FIFE sites located primarily on the Konza Prairie. These measurements were acquired in conjunction with the Surface Reflectances measured by the PARABOLA bi-directional measurements. Ground SE-590 data were acquired in all four 1987 Intensive Field Campaigns and in the 1989 Intensive Field Campaign. The ground SE-590 data were collected at approximately every 10 degree change in solar zenith angle (SZA) to characterize diurnal variations and/or simultaneous observations acquired by helicopter, airplane, or satellite over flights. The data were collected as wavelength intensity values which were converted to spectral radiances with instrument and campaign-specific calibration coefficients.",
