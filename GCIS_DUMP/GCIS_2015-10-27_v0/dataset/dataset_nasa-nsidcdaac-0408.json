    "description": "Notice to Data Users: The documentation for this data set was provided solely by the Principal Investigator(s) and was not further developed, thoroughly reviewed, or edited by NSIDC. Thus, support for this data set may be limited. This data set includes photographs of the regional study areas of Arizona, USA and Sonora, Mexico as part of the 2004 Soil Moisture Experiment (SMEX04). The photographs were taken in the field at various locations during the SMEX04 campaign from 29 July 2004 to 25 August 2004. This collection of images is intended to be a visual aid to investigators of the SMEX04 data sets, as they display the conditions present during the SMEX04 campaign. The total volume for this data set is approximately 300 megabytes. The photographs are provided in JPEG image files and are available via FTP. These data were collected as part of a validation study for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). AMSR-E is a mission instrument launched aboard NASA's Aqua Satellite on 04 May 2002. AMSR-E validation studies linked to SMEX are designed to evaluate the accuracy of AMSR-E soil moisture data. Specific validation objectives include assessing and refining soil moisture algorithm performance; verifying soil moisture estimation accuracy; investigating the effects of vegetation, surface temperature, topography, and soil texture on soil moisture accuracy; and determining the regions that are useful for AMSR-E soil moisture measurements.",
