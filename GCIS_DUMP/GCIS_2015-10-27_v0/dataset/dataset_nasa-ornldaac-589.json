    "description": "ABSTRACT: This land cover product was produced by NBIOME to generate an up-to-date, spatially and temporally consistent land cover map of the landmass of Canada for use by scientists and other users interested in environmental information at national and regional scales. The data were acquired by CCRS and were provided to BORIS for use. This data set is gridded and was produced from 10-day composite data of surface parameters. Temporally, the 10-day compositing periods begin 11-April-95 and ends 31-Oct-95. Spatially, the data cover the entire landmass of Canada. The data are stored in binary image format files.",
