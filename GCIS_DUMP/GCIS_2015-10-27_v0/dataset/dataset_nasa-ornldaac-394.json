    "description": "ABSTRACT: The TGB-08 team collected data to investigate the controls over non-methane hydrocarbon (NMHC) fluxes from boreal forest tree species. This data set includes measurements of starch concentrations in foliar samples at mature Jack Pine and Black spruce sites. The two areas used in this research were in the Southern Study Area (SSA) of the BOREAS region: the SSA Old Jack Pine (OJP) and Old Black Spruce(OBS) tower-flux locations. These areas contained mature stands of jack pine and black spruce and were the focal sites in the BOREAS program for studies of biosphere/atmosphere exchange from these two habitat types. The OBS site is situated in a black spruce/sphagnum bog with the largest trees 155 years old and 10-15 m. tall. The OJP site is in a jack pine forest, 80 to 120 years old, which lies on a sandy bench of glacial outwash with the largest tree standing 15 m. tall. Temporally, the data cover the period of 24-May-94 to 19-Sep-94.",
