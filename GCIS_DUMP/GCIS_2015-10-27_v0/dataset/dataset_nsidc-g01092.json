    "description": "The HSDSD product is based on observations from 284 World Meteorological Organization (WMO) stations throughout Russia and the former Soviet Union. The area covered is 35 to 75 degrees north latitude and 20 to 180 degrees east longitude. The State Hydrometeorological Service in Obninsk, Russia, sent the data to NSIDC through the bilateral US-USSR Working Group Eight data exchange program. The development of this data product was funded through NOAA's Environmental Services Data and Information Management (ESDIM) program, and through the support of the NOAA/NESDIS National Geophysical Data Center. Data are available on one CD-ROM available for download via FTP.",
