    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set contains field observations, corresponding GPS points, and point and polygons of deforested areas in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, for the period March 17-24, 2005. Fieldwork was conducted in the regions surrounding Sinop, Mato Grosso, with specific emphasis on large clearings occurring in the Xingu Basin. The field campaign was designed to validate preliminary MODIS deforestation products designed to detect deforestation during the wet season. There are five data files with this data set. This includes four shapefiles (.shp) and one comma-separated file (.csv).",
