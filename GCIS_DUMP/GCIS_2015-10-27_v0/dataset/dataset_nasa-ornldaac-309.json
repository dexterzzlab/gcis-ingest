    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set consists of GIS layers that describe the soils of the BOREAS SSA. The original data were submitted as vector layers that were gridded by BOREAS staff to a 30-meter pixel size in the AEAC projection. These data layers include the soil code (which relates to the soil name), modifier (which also relates to the soil name), and extent (indicating the extent that this soil exists within the polygon). There are three sets of these layers representing the primary, secondary, and tertiary soil characteristics. Thus, there is a total of nine layers in this data set along with supporting files. The data are stored in binary, image format files.",
