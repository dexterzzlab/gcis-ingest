    "description": "ABSTRACT: The BOREAS RSS-03 team collected helicopter-based video coverage of forested sites acquired during BOREAS as well as single-frame \"snapshots\" processed to still images. Helicopter data used in this analysis were collected during all three IFCs of 24 May-16 June, 19 July-10 August, and 30 August-19 September, at numerous tower and auxiliary sites in both the NSA and SSA. The VHS-camera observations correspond to other coincident helicopter measurements. The field of view of the camera is unknown. The video tapes are in both VHS and Beta format. The still images are stored as JPEG.",
