    "description": "This dataset contains along track geo-referenced Sea Surface Height Anomalies (SSHA) from TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1 and OSTM/Jason-2 (depending on time period) merged into a single mean reference orbit. All biases and cross-calibrations have been applied to the data so SSHA are consistent between satellites to form a single climate data record. Altimeter data from the multi-mission Geophysical Data Records (GDRs) are interpolated to a common reference orbit facilitating direct time series analysis of the geo-referenced SSH. The data are in netCDF format in an array based on 3-dimensions (rev#, index, cycle) that permits direct access of individual locations at specific times (i.e., temporal and spatial sub-sampling). Each file consists of one cycle of data, which is approximately 10 days long. Cycle 001 coincides with cycle 001 of TOPEX/Poseidon (September 25-October 3, 1992) and is presently updated to cycle 748, which coincides with OSTM/Jason-2 cycle 166 (January 3-13, 2013).",
