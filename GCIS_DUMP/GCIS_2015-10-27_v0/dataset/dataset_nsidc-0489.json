    "description": "This data set provides grounding line and hydrostatic line locations for the Antarctic coastline and islands around Antarctica. The data are derived using customized software to combine data from Landsat-7 imagery and Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) laser altimetry, which were primarily collected between 1999 to 2003. The data set also includes elevations along each line, selected from six candidate digital elevation models. The data were developed as part of the Antarctic Surface Accumulation and Ice Discharge (ASAID) project. Data are available via FTP, provided in both ASCII text (.txt) and shapefile (.shp, .dbf, .shx) formats.",
