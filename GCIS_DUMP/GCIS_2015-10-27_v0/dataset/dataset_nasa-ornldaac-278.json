    "description": "ABSTRACT: The BOREAS HYD-09 team collected data on precipitation and streamflow over portions of the NSA and SSA. This data set contains Cartesian maps of rain accumulation for 1-hour and daily periods during the summer of 1994 over the SSA only (not the full view of the radar). A parallel set of 1-hour maps for the whole radar view has been prepared and is available upon request from the HYD-09 personnel. An incidental benefit of the areal selection was the elimination of some of the less accurate data, because for various reasons the radar rain estimates degrade considerably outside a range of about 100 km. The data are available in tabular ASCII files.",
