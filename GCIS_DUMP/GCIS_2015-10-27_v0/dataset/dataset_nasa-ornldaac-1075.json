    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set reports field estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity measurements from June 12 through June 20, 2001. This study was part of a rainfall exclusion experiment that was conducted from 1999-2001 at the km 67 Seca Floresta site, Tapajos National Forest, Para, Brazil. The objective of this component of the study was to develop an understanding of the physical processes driving the observed soil water dynamics at the site. There is one comma-delimited ASCII data file with this data set.",
