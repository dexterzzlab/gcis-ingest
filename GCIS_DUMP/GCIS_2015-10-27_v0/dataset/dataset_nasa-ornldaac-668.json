    "description": "ABSTRACT: Directional reflected radiation was measured over plots representing selected canopy components (shrubs and individual plants, bare sand, and background) at the Jornada Experiment Range site near Las Cruces, New Mexico, during the Prototype Validation Experiment (PROVE) in May 1997.At each plot, directional reflected radiation was measured in the solar principal plane; directional reflected radiation in the plane perpendicular to the solar principle plane were measured next (by rotating the mast around the plot so that the pivoting point is 90 degrees from the initial pivoting location). View zenith angles of 60, 45, 30 and 15 degrees in the back and forward scatter directions of nadir were measured in each plane. Nadir-viewed reflected radiation was measured for each plane as well.",
