    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set is a compilation of carbon and energy eddy covariance flux, meteorology, radiation, canopy temperature, humidity, and CO2 profiles and soil moisture and temperature profile data that were collected at nine towers across the Brazilian Amazon. Independent investigators provided the data from a variety of flux tower projects over the period 1999 thru 2006. The data have been harmonized across projects, additional quality control checks were performed, and the data were aggregated to several time intervals. Two versions of data are provided. One version is as received from the investigators and the second was processed through a series of automated and manual quality control steps. This data set includes 18 compressed (*.zip) data files with the two versions of data files for each of the nine sites.",
