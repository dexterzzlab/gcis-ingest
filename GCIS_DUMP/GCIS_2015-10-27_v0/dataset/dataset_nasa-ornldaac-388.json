    "description": "ABSTRACT: The BOREAS TGB-06 team collected soil methane measurements at several sites in the SSA and NSA. This data set contains soil methane consumption (bacterial CH4 oxidation) and associated 13C fractionation effects in samples that were collected at various sites in 1994 and 1996 from enclosures (chambers). Methane 13C data in soil gas samples from the NSA YJP and OJP sites for 1994 and 1996 are also given. Additional data on the isotopic composition of methane (carbon and hydrogen isotopes) produced in the NSA beaver ponds and fen bog in 1993 and 1994 are given as well.",
