    "description": "ABSTRACT: Under-canopy precipitation measurements were made by the BOREAS HYD-01 science team in 1994, 1995, and 1996 at various flux tower sites in the NSA and SSA. In 1994, these data were collected at the NSA-OJP, NSA-YJP, SSA-OJP, and SSA-YJP sites. Starting in 1995 and ending in 1997, data were collected at the NSA-OBS, NSA-OJP, NSA-YJP, and SSA-OA. These data were collected to support HYD-01 research by measuring the amount of water that falls through the canopy and is intercepted by the ground or moss. These data coincide with volumetric soil moisture measurements made by HYD-01.",
