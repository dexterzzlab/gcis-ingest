    "description": "This data set includes calibrated brightness temperatures measured over Wakasa Bay in the Sea of Japan in January and February 2003. The MIR was carried on a military-type P-3 aircraft. Brightness temperatures were taken at 57 beam positions covering 100 degrees swath. These data were acquired in support of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) Wakasa Bay Field Campaign. Data are available in binary format from NSIDC via FTP. AMSR-E is a mission instrument launched aboard NASA's Aqua Satellite on 4 May 2002. The Wakasa Bay Field Campaign was designed to validate both AMSR and AMSR-E shallow rainfall and snowfall retrieval capabilities.",
