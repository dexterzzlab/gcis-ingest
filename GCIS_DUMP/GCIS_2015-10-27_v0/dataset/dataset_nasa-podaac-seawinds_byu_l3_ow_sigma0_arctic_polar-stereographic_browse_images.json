    "description": "This dataset contains GIF images of polar-stereographic-gridded, daily averaged Sigma-0 retrievals over the Arctic Polar from the SeaWinds L1B retrievals, which are generated using a Scatterometer Image Reconstruction (SIR) technique developed by Dr. David Long at Brigham Young University (BYU. The SeaWinds scatterometer scans at two nominal incidence angles, 46 degrees and 54.1 degrees, corresponding to the inner and outer beams respectively. The inner beam is horizontally polarized while the outer beam is vertically polarized. The GIF image files are separated according to polarization, and the averaged Sigma-0 measurements are displayed in grayscale with no color bar. Very bright areas indicate high Sigma-0 averages. It should be noted that these GIF images are meant for browse purposes only and should not be considered science quality. The science quality source dataset containing the SIR files used to generate the GIF images is accessible here: http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/SEAWINDS_BYU_L3_OW_SIGMA0_ARCTIC_POLAR-STEREOGRAPHIC_BROWSE_MAPS_LITE. An additional complimentary dataset of SIR files contains the full daily Sigma-0 statistcs: http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/SEAWINDS_BYU_L3_OW_SIGMA0_ARCTIC_POLAR-STEREOGRAPHIC_BROWSE_MAPS_FULL. This dataset is generated by the Scatterometer Climate Record Pathfinder (SCP) project at BYU.",
