    "description": "Notice to Data Users: The documentation for this data set was provided solely by the Principal Investigator(s) and was not further developed, thoroughly reviewed, or edited by NSIDC. Thus, support for this data set may be limited. This data set contains vegetation water content data of the Ames, Iowa, USA area. Large-scale maps of vegetation water content are necessary for the accurate estimation of surface soil moisture via microwave remote sensing. To support this type of remote sensing during the Soil Moisture Experiment 2005 (SMEX05), a vegetation sampling campaign was conducted in coordination with satellite calibration and correction to result in an estimated map of Vegetation Water Content (VWC). The data were collected on 06 June 2005 and 17 July 2005. The total volume of this data set is approximately 56 megabytes. Data are provided in Band Interleaved by Line (BIL) files with corresponding Environment for Visualizing Images (ENVI) header files, and are available via FTP. The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) is a mission instrument launched aboard NASA's Aqua satellite on 04 May 2002. AMSR-E validation studies linked to SMEX are designed to evaluate the accuracy of AMSR-E soil moisture data. Specific validation objectives include: assessing and refining soil moisture algorithm performance; verifying soil moisture estimation accuracy; investigating the effects of vegetation, surface temperature, topography, and soil texture on soil moisture accuracy; and determining the regions that are useful for AMSR-E soil moisture measurements.",
