    "description": "This data set includes rainfall data from 25 sites in Iowa, centered on the Iowa City Municipal Airport. The collection sites form an approximately regular grid with spacing of 5 km. At each site there are two tipping bucket rain gauges. Data were collected between June 2002 and November 2003. The network is a collaborative effort between NASA, NOAA, the University of Maryland, and the University of Iowa. The experiment was designed to validate the AMSR-E rainfall measurements. The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) is a mission instrument launched aboard NASA's Aqua Satellite on 4 May 2002. AMSR-E validation studies linked to rainfall experiments are designed to evaluate the accuracy of AMSR-E precipitation data.",
