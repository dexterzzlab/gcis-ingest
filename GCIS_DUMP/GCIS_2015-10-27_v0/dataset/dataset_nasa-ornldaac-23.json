    "description": "ABSTRACT: The Bowen Ratio Surface Flux Observations (UNL) Data Set contains surface flux and micrometeorolgical measurements collected at one location located in a flat area of uniform surface vegetation approximately in the center of the FIFE study area. The data collection effort was during the four Intensive Field Campaigns in the spring, summer, and fall of 1987 (May 28 - Oct 17). The Bowen ratio system that collected these data was designed to retrieve all major components of the surface energy budget along with a large set of measured and derived parameters describing the dynamical, thermodynamical, hydrological, and radiative properties of the ground surface and atmosphere surface layer.",
