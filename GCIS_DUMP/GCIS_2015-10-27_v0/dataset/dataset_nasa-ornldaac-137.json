    "description": "ABSTRACT: The Konza Natural Research Area is a tallgrass prairie in a biologically heterogeneous environment that is rich in native plant species. Species composition is extremely variable over sites because of the effects of both natural and anthropological factors. The FIFE Vegetation Species Reference Data Set is used to associate the plant species found on the Konza Prairie with both their common and Latin names, and to translate the species codes found in the FIFE vegetation data sets to their Latin and common names.",
