    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set contains percent soil moisture (by weight) (and/or water content if there is a moss/humus layers measured from aircraft using a terrestrial gamma ray instrument. There is also data that indicates the location of the aircraft at the time it collected the terrestrial gamma ray data for the various flight lines and bins. The location information contains a list of coordinates that indicate the path of the aircraft for each bin. The data were collected during four time periods from September 1993 to September 1994 over the Southern Study Area (SSA) and two time periods from February to August 1994 over the Northern Study Area (NSA).",
