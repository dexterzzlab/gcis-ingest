    "description": "The MODIS Mosaic of Antarctica 2008-2009 (MOA2009) Image Map consists of two cloud-free digital image maps that show mean surface morphology and a quantitative measure of optical snow grain size on the Antarctic continent and surrounding islands using 260 orbit swaths from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments on board the NASA EOS Aqua and Terra satellites. The 259 orbit swaths used to create the MOA2009 Surface Morphology Image Map were acquired 1 November 2008 through 28 February 2009 for the full spring-summer season. The 142 orbit swaths used to create the MOA2009 Grain Size Image Map were acquired 1 November 2008 through 16 December 2008 for the shortened spring-only season. Vector data sets with the corresponding coastlines, ice sheet grounding lines, and islands are also provided.",
