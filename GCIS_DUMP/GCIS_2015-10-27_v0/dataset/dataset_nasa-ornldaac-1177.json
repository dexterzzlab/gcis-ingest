    "description": "ABSTRACT: The source meteorological observations for the forcing data, from the nine Brazilian flux towers, were recently published as Saleska, et al. (2013). See related data sets. These source data were gap-filled according to the LBA-MIP standard protocol. Note that the CAX forest tower was not included in the MIP. See the companion file driver_data.pdf for additional gap-filling information. There are 34 data products with this data set and they are provided in both text (.txt) and ALMA-compliant NetCDF (.nc) formats. The files have been compressed into nine *.zip files according to site.",
