    "description": "ABSTRACT: The Leaf Area Index and PAR Determined from the UNL Light Bar Data were collected in 1987, 1988, and 1989. Incoming, reflected, and transmitted photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was measured with a LI-COR LI-191SA line quantum sensor. Absorbed and intercepted PAR calculated from these measurements. The objectives of this research were to characterize bi-directional reflectance factor distributions, estimate surface albedo, determine the variability of reflected and emitted fluxes in selected spectral wavebands as a function of topography, vegetative community and management practice, determine the influence of plant water status on surface reflectance factors, and determine sun angle affects on radiation fluxes.",
