    "description": "This dataset contains GIF images of global, rectangular-gridded, daily averaged Sigma-0 retrievals from the SeaWinds L1B retrievals, which are generated using a Scatterometer Image Reconstruction (SIR) technique developed by Dr. David Long at Brigham Young University (BYU). The SeaWinds scatterometer scans at two nominal incidence angles, 46 degrees and 54.1 degrees, corresponding to the inner and outer beams respectively. The inner beam is horizontally polarized while the outer beam is vertically polarized. The GIF image files are separated according to polarization, and the averaged Sigma-0 measurements are displayed in grayscale with no color bar. Very bright areas indicate high Sigma-0 averages. These SIR files were also used to generate a complimentary dataset of GIF images representing the daily averaged Sigma-0, which is meant for browse purposes only and available here: http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/SEAWINDS_BYU_L3_OW_SIGMA0_GLOBAL_RECTANGULAR_BROWSE_IMAGES. An additional complimentary dataset includes a reduced version of these Sigma-0 retrieval statistics by providing only the daily Sigma-0 average: http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/SEAWINDS_BYU_L3_OW_SIGMA0_GLOBAL_RECTANGULAR_BROWSE_MAPS_LITE. This dataset is generated by the Scatterometer Climate Record Pathfinder (SCP) project at BYU.",
