    "description": "ABSTRACT: The gravimetrical soil moisture data were collected from many stations spread over the FIFE study area. These data were collected to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of moisture content of the soils over this area during and between the FIFE Intensive Field Campaigns. The aim of the FIFE soil moisture work was to characterize spatial and temporal patterns of soil moisture at the FIFE site, to validate and calibrate remote sensing measurements of soil water, and to evaluate alternative methods of measuring soil moisture both from the air and on the ground. A further goal was to develop techniques for comparing point and spatially continuous measurements of soil moisture. The FIFE soil moisture research was designed to advance the technology for characterizing soil moisture and contribute useful data to other FIFE investigations.",
