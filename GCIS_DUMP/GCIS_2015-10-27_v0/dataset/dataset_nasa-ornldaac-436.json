    "description": "ABSTRACT: The BOREAS Staff Science Aircraft Data Acquisition Program focused on providing the research teams with the remotely sensed satellite data products they needed to compare and spatially extend point results. For BOREAS, the TIMS imagery, along with other aircraft images, was collected to provide spatially extensive information over the primary study areas. The level-1B TIMS images cover the time periods of 16-Apr-1994 to 20-Apr-1994 and 06-Sep-1994 to 17-Sep-1994. The system calibrated images are stored in binary image format files. Companion files include (1) an image inventory listing to inform users of the images that are available and (2) example thumbnail images.",
