    "description": "ABSTRACT: This dataset is a 1:2 million scale forest cover map for the land area of the Krasnoyarsk Region, Russia. Thirty-two land cover classes are distinguished. These data were digitized from maps of the Atlas of Forests of the USSR (Anon. 1973). This map should not be strictly viewed as a map of actual forest cover, but rather as a map of dominant tree species. Very few tree species are defined, and generally, each polygon and color has only one tree species assigned to it.",
