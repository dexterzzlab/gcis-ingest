    "description": "ABSTRACT: The BOREAS HYD-08 team made measurements of surface hydrological processes that were collected at the NSA OBS Tower Flux site in 1994 and at Joey Lake, Manitoba, to support their research into point hydrological processes and the spatial variation of these processes. The data collected may be useful in characterizing canopy interception, drip, throughfall, moss interception, drainage, evaporation, and capacity during the growing season at daily temporal resolution. This particular data set contains the gravimetric moss moisture measurements from June to September 1994. A nested spatial sampling plan was implemented to support research into spatial variations of the measured hydrological processes and ultimately the impact of these variations on modeled carbon and water budgets.",
