    "description": "ABSTRACT: The BOREAS TE-06 team collected several data sets to examine the influence of vegetation, climate, and their interactions on the major carbon fluxes for boreal forest species. This data set contains summaries of predawn leaf water potentials and foliage moisture contents collected at the TF and CEV sites that had canopy access towers. The data was collected on a nearly weekly basis from early June to late August 1994 by TE-06, members of the BOREAS staff, and employees of Environment Canada.",
