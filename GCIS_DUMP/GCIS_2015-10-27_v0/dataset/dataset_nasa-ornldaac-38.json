    "description": "ABSTRACT: During the 1989 Intensive Field Campaign a Russian spectroradiometer, the Gemma, was used to collect visible and near infrared spectra of a variety of FIFE sites from a helicopter. Gemma measurements of selected study sites and laboratory measurements of a portable calibration light sphere were made. The helicopter missions were designed to provide characterizations of each FIFE site while providing FIFE study area coverage, and to provide an intermediate scale of sampling between that of the surface measurements and the higher altitude aircraft and spacecraft multispectral imaging devices. The Gemma spectroradiometer was mounted on the helicopter to allow a comparison between it and the SE-590 spectroradiometer and Modular Multiband Radiometer (MMR) over a number of sites.",
