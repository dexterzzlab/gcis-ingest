    "description": "This data set provides imagery developed from Landsat 5 and 7 Thematic Mapper (TM) data for use in studying land cover features during the Soil Moisture Experiment 2002 (SMEX02). The images are the result of combining bands 4, 3, and 2 as red, green, and blue to generate false-color composites. This study was conducted during June and July 2002 in the area of the Ames, Iowa, USA. One false-color image is provided for each day. Data are provided in Georeferenced Tagged Image File Format (GeoTIFF) formatted files and TIFF world files (TFW), and are available via FTP. These data were collected as part of a validation study for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). AMSR-E is a mission instrument launched aboard NASA's Aqua Satellite on 04 May 2002. AMSR-E validation studies linked to SMEX are designed to evaluate the accuracy of AMSR-E soil moisture data. Specific validation objectives include assessing and refining soil moisture algorithm performance; verifying soil moisture estimation accuracy; investigating the effects of vegetation, surface temperature, topography, and soil texture on soil moisture accuracy; and determining the regions that are useful for AMSR-E soil moisture measurements.",
