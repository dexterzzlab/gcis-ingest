    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set was gridded from vector layers of soil maps that were received from Dr. Darwin Anderson TE-01 who did the original soil mapping in the field during 1994. The vector layers were gridded into raster files that cover approximately 1 square kilometer over each of the tower sites in the SSA.",
