    "description": "This data set provides a coastline history of the eastern Amundsen Sea Embayment and terminus histories of its outlet glaciers derived from those coastlines. These outlet glaciers include Smith, Haynes, Thwaites, and Pine Island Glaciers. The coastlines were derived from detailed tracing of Landsat imagery between late 1972 and late 2011 (at a scale of 1:50,000). The data set also uses some additional data from other sources. The terminus histories are calculated as the intersections between these coastlines and 1996 flowlines. Data are available via FTP in ESRI shapefile and comma separated value (.csv) formats.",
