    "description": "ABSTRACT: Weather data were collected by the National Weather Service in International Falls, Minnesota. International Falls is about 80 miles from the SNF, but the weather data is representative of the area. Total solar insolation measurements were made at Fall Lake Dam in Winton, Minn. by Prof. Donald Baker of the Department of Soil Science at the University of Minnesota, St. Paul. Insolation values were measured using a Yellow Springs solar cell calibrated against an Eppley Pyranometer.",
