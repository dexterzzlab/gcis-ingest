    "description": "ABSTRACT: The Bowen Ratio Surface Flux Observations (Smith) Data Set contains surface flux measurements made at selected sites within the FIFE area. The collection effort was conducted in 1987, 1988, and 1989 from sites equipped with Bowen ratio equipment operated by several different groups. Each surface flux station was capable of measuring the fluxes of net radiation, sensible heat, and latent heat using. The Bowen ratio stations measured the soil heat flux as well. The surface flux and micrometeorological measurements available in this data set were collected from 2 locations within the FIFE study area. One of these sites was located at the bottom of a valley while the other was on the top of a ridge. During the IFC's data were collected daily.",
