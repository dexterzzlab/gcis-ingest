    "description": "ABSTRACT: The BOREAS TGB-03 team collected several data sets that contributed to understanding the measured trace gas fluxes over sites in the NSA. This data set contains information about the composition of plant species that were within the collars used to measure NEE. The species composition was identified to understand the differences in NEE among the various plant communities in the NSA fen. The data were collected in July of 1994 and 1996.",
