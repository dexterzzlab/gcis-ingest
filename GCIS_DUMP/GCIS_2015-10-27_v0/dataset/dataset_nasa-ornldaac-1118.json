    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set reports the results of vegetation field surveys that measured tree height and diameter at breast height (DBH) in defined size classes at three study sites -- Santarem, Para; Paragominas, Para; and Alo Brasil, Mato Grosso, Brazil, from 2001-2003. At each site, plots and transects within plots, were defined that represented different types of logging and fire treatments, each including one primary forest plot used as a control. Along each transect all trees with more than 30 cm DBH were measured. Dead standing trees were also measured and classified in three classes of decomposition. A 4 m wide transect was used to measure individuals between 10 and 30 cm DBH. Six small subplots were set along each transect to measure regeneration individuals from 2-10 cm DBH and 0-2 cm DBH. DBH is also provided for stumps found in each of the logged forest plots. There are ten comma-delimited data files with this data set.",
