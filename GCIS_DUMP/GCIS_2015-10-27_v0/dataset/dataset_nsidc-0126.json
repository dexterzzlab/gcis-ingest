    "description": "This data set is part of the WAISCORES project, an NSF-funded project to understand the influence of the West Antarctic ice sheet on climate and sea level change. WAISCORES researchers acquired and analyzed ice cores from the Siple Dome, in the Siple Coast region, West Antarctica. This data set includes backscattered electron images of tephra samples extracted from the Siple and Taylor Dome ice cores, as well as electron microprobe analyses of glass shards in cases where significant, compositionally-consistent glass populations were present. The data set also includes data on the amount of volcanically derived sulfate deposited on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and recorded in the Siple Dome ice core.",
