    "description": "These data consist of ice-penetrating radar data collected on the ground across the grounding line near Siple Dome during the 2006 and 2007 Antarctic summer field seasons. Primarily, the data consist of low-frequency radar data (2 MHz, approximately 50 meter resolution) in order to observe deep internal layers and the ice-bed interface. The data set also contains one file with high-frequency (100 MHz, approximately 1 meter resolution) radar data, for a sub-region of one of the low-frequency radar profiles. Coincident kinematic GPS data were also collected to correct the radar data for topography along each profile. Radar profiles are typically approximately 20 km in length with the grounding line crossed centrally where possible. Data are available via FTP in Matlab (.mat) format.",
