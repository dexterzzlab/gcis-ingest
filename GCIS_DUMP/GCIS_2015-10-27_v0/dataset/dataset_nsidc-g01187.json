    "description": "This data set consists of river ice thickness measurements, and beginning and ending dates for river freeze-up events from fifty stations in northern Russia. The data set includes values from 1917 through 1992, however the record length varies for each station. The longest station record covers the period 1917 through 1988 (the station table shows the beginning and end years for measurements at each station). Data were obtained through the U.S.-Russia Working Group VIII of the U.S.-Russia Bilateral Agreement on the Protection of Environmental and Natural Resources.",
