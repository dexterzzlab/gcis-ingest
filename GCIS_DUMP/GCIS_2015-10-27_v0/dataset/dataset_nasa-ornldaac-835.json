    "description": "ABSTRACT: The MOPITT (Measurements Of Pollution In The Troposphere) instrument on the NASA Terra Satellite makes measurements of infrared radiation originating from the surface of the planet and isolates the energy being radiated from carbon monoxide (CO). By using appropriate data analysis techniques, concentration profiles of CO (Level-2 (L2) data) can be obtained on a global basis at a reasonably high horizontal (~22km) and vertical resolution (~3km).The MOPITT Level-3 (L3) data products provided in this data set are a subset of the daily averages from the L2 data. This subset was produced by overlaying a global 1x1-degree grid onto the L2 data, and then clipping the data to this southern Africa subset which originates at 5 degrees longitude and -35 degrees latitude and extends to 60 degrees longitude and 35 degrees latitude. Data are reported for 2 heights, 700 and 350 hPa, from daytime swaths for the period August 1-September 30, 2000, the SAFARI 2000 Dry Season Campaign.",
