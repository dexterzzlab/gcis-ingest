    "description": "ABSTRACT: Tower flux and meteorological data were collected above 4 black spruce forest sites in the NSA that experienced stand-replacing wildfires in 1989,1981,1964 and 1930. At each site, 4-6 weeks of data were collected during the peak growing season (June-September) in either 1999 or 2000. Fluxes were measured using paired portable solar powered eddy flux systems. The data are part of an ongoing age sequence study that will result in year round eddy flux and meteorological measurements in seven sites that burned between 2 and 150 years ago.",
