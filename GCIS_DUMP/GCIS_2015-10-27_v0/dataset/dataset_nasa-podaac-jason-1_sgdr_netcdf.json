    "description": "The Sensory Geophysical Data Record (SGDR) files contain full accuracy altimeter data, with a high precision orbit (accuracy ~2.5 cm), provided approximately 35 days after data collection. The instruments on Jason-1 make direct observations of the following quantities: altimeter range, significant wave height, ocean radar backscatter cross-section (a measure of wind speed), ionospheric electron content (derived by a simple formula), tropospheric water content, mean sea surface, and position relative to the GPS satellite constellation. The SGDR contain all relevant corrections needed to calculate the sea surface height. It also contains the 20Hz waveforms that are required for retracking. The SGDR is an expert level product, if you do not require the waveforms then the GDR will be more suited for your needs. The NetCDF format is not the official format from the Jason-1 project and is therefore not validated. If you require validated data please use the binary version.",
