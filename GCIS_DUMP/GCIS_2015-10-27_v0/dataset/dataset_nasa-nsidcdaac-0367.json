    "description": "Notice to Data Users: The documentation for this data set was provided solely by the Principal Investigator(s) and was not further developed, thoroughly reviewed, or edited by NSIDC. Thus, support for this data set may be limited. This ancillary data set consists of geographic coordinates for the Soil Moisture Experiment 2003 (SMEX03). Geolocation information is provided for SMEX03 rainfall network and gravimetric sampling locations conducted in the regional study area of Georgia, USA. Geolocation information is also provided for rain gauge sites in the Little River (LR) micronet located within the state of Georgia. Coordinates were obtained 1 July 2003 using Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements. The volume of the data set is approximately 30 kilobytes. Data are provided in one tab-delimited ASCII text file and one Microsoft Excel file, and are available via FTP. These data were collected as part of a validation study for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). AMSR-E is a mission instrument launched aboard NASA's Aqua Satellite on 04 May 2002. AMSR-E validation studies linked to SMEX are designed to evaluate the accuracy of AMSR-E soil moisture data. Specific validation objectives include assessing and refining soil moisture algorithm performance; verifying soil moisture estimation accuracy; investigating the effects of vegetation, surface temperature, topography, and soil texture on soil moisture accuracy; and determining the regions that are useful for AMSR-E soil moisture measurements.",
