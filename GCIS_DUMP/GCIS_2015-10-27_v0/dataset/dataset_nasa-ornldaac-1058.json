    "description": "ABSTRACT: This data set contains the boundaries of the four major cities in the Northern Ecuadorian Amazon, the locations of primary communities in the colonist settlement area, and the locations of the road network, circa 2002. This area in northeastern Ecuador, know as the northern Oriente of Ecuador, borders the Andes Mountains and contains the headwaters of the Amazon River. The road network was originally digitized from 1:50,000 scale topographic maps from 1990. The surface attributes for the majority of the roads have been updated based on later remote sensing and field observations from 1999 and 2002. There are three compressed (*.zip) files with this data set.",
