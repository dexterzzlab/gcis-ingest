    "description": "In October 2005, three geodetic GPS receivers were deployed on the Ross Ice Shelf near the ice front to observe short-term fluctuations in ice-shelf velocity associated with tidal forcing and other phenomena. Two stations were placed on either side of a large rift that is expected to eventually create the next iceberg to calve from the Ross Ice Shelf (called \"Nascent Iceberg\"). One station was established at a location near station R13, occupied in 1979 during the RIGGS project (Thomas et al., 1984), to determine if the near-ice-front part of the Ross Ice Shelf has significantly changed its long-term flow since the late 1970s.",
