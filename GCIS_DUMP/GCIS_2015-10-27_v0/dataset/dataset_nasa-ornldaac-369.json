    "description": "ABSTRACT: The BOREAS TF-11 team collected several data sets in their efforts to fully describe the flux and site characteristics at the SSA-Fen site. This data set contains plant cover, standing crop of plant biomass, and estimated net primary productivity at each chamber site at the end of the 1994 field season. The measurements were conducted as part of a 2x2 factorial experiment in which we added carbon (300 g m-2 as wheat straw) and nitrogen (6 g m-2 as urea) to four replicate locations in the vicinity of the TF-11 tower.",
