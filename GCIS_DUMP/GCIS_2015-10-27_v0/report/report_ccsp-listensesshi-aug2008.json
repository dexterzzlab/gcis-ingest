    "summary": "On August 5, 2008, the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP), with NOAA as the lead agency for this session, convened a listening session of nearly 60 stakeholders at the Pacific Climate Information System Steering Committee and Working Group Meeting in Honolulu, Hawaii for 1.5 hours. Most of the stakeholders came from organizations that have investments in research focused on understanding the physical mechanisms behind climate change and its impact on the Pacific islands. Stakeholders associated with the U.S. federal government constituted 54% of the audience, while those from academia, other foreign governments, and business represented 21%, 23%, and 2% respectively. Included in the stakeholder participants were scientists serving as members of the Pacific Climate Information System (PaCIS) Steering Committee or working groups.",
