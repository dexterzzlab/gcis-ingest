After a century of\r\n    isolation behind dikes (left), much of the Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge was reconnected with tidal flow in 2009 by\r\n    removal of a major dike and restoration of 762 acres (right), with the assistance of Ducks Unlimited and the Nisqually Indian\r\n    Tribe. This reconnected more than 21 miles of historical tidal channels and floodplains with Puget\r\n    Sound.<tbib>57ade57f-f478-4008-882f-9e46fd08ae2d</tbib> A new exterior dike was constructed to protect\r\n    freshwater wetland habitat for migratory birds from tidal inundation and future sea level rise. Combined with expansion of the\r\n    authorized Refuge boundary, ongoing acquisition efforts to expand the Refuge will enhance the ability to provide diverse\r\n    estuary and freshwater habitats despite rising sea level, increasing river floods, and loss of estuarine habitat elsewhere in\r\n    Puget Sound. This project is considered a major step in increasing estuary habitat and recovering the greater Puget Sound\r\n    estuary.
